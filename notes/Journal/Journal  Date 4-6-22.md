## My Thoughts Currently
It’s 2:55 AM, and I decided to just have an outlet for my thoughts for once… before, they’d just bounce off the wall of my head and disappear into the void that is forgetfulness. 

Things aren’t too well… well, they haven’t been well for a few years now.. it seems after my Senior year of Highschool, my mental performance/emotional balance/social life all tapered off in the ensuing years..

In college, I struggled noticeably more, but it all included one common denominator: _fatigue_.
I simply wouldn’t have the motivation or energy to go out, drive, get my license, and it also made it very difficult to do my work… of course, there was a large percent of personal-mistakes that was solely due to my lack of effort… 

Since then, I’ve tried numerous different medications, had blood-work done, anything to try and figure out this “fatigue”… 

## Gameplan:
#### Possible Causes:
- Lack of Exercise
- Lack of Sunlight
- Perhaps it’s just a reflection of my personality problems?
- Stimulant-related
	- No more Dopamine?
	- Dopamine receptor-downregulation 
		- After years of taking Vyvanse, maybe it’s just taken its toll.. 
- abusing pr0n

### Action 
_To do_: 
1. Try and aim for atleast 10 minutes of exercise a day… But jesus, why do I never feel like doing it anymore? It’s so hard and feels like such drudgery… 
2. Take a Multi-vitamin 
3. Related to the third possible cause, referencing if it’s caused by personality problems; **I will need to <u>reflect**</u> . What do *I feel*? 
4. But what I’m currently trying is repairing my dopamine receptors. I am optimistic that I will feel the energy and motivation I once had 6-7 years ago… in high school 

*For this*, I have compiled a stack of Nootropics.. 
My current stack:
1. Good ol’ [[Inositol]]
2. [[Sulbutiamine]] 
3. [[Cordyceps]] 
4. And, when it arrives, [[9-me-bc]]
