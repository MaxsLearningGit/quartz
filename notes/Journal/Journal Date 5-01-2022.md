10 Days before Birthday

## Feelings
I feel pretty depressed in this present moment… I don’t know if it’s due to 
- abruptly stopping Prozac in order to use [[9-me-bc]], or 
- if it’s my horrid sleep schedule (I woke up at 5 PM today, and have woken up even later at times, all during this past month.)
- Just general blues?

But overall, I feel sad that I’m aging… I just keep replaying the past, especially high school and graduation and I wonder where the last 5 years of my life has gone… I’m still so naïve and lethargic — a walking ball of self-defeat.. Like I’ve just given up even trying to get out there and get a job…. I haven’t even showered for weeks! 

That, along with my weird inclination to be afraid to carry on conversations with friends on Discord, Instagram, Facebook, etc. That I ghost them for months on end when I should have given a reply.. 
….I’m just scared and I push it to the back of my mind, and that’s how it happens… that’s how I give such late responses.. 

Hopefully I can get to sleeping better, feeling better, and helping my family.. I’m still anxious about all my family, especially after my dad quit recently due to general disrespect and terrible coworkers on the job site.

22:56, 10:56 PM -  Just trying to relax — I have a Xanax, and I just want to relax… I dunno if I’ve mentioned it before, but I have an odd paranoia regarding time and objects - and how impermanent they are..

I guess I’m afraid of knowing how much time has passed, or that I’m afraid I’ll grow old and have nothing to show for it — a sense that I’m wasting away my prime years… it’s very distressing. 

I want to remember my past, and not completely forget these moments… these _things_… 

For example, I keep alot of my old medication bottles (even years old), just because I want to know what I’ve been on… maybe because I’m afraid to throw them away and become ignorant? 
— I also keep alot of old notes (especially from college), and I make back-up photos of things such as notes from my family which are frequently laid on the kitchen counter… Like my momma said, I get sentimental about these things… 

now it’s 11:02 PM, so I spent a good 6 minutes on these thoughts… I feel it reflects how I feel to a good level…
