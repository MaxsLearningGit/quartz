> - V key: Switches to pointer (so you can grab stuff in the composition panel)
> - H key: Switches to grab/hand (So you can grab and maneuver around the project )

## Lessons📝 
- Lesson 1: Getting Started
	 - Just general pointers— 
 - Lesson 2: Panels
	- After Effects’ workspace contains __panels__; just like Sony Vegas, Photoshop, etc., you are able to reposition and reframe your workspace to fit your needs. You don’t need the audio tab? Remove it, or place it inside the box to create a tab within another panel.. In this way, you can focus on what you want, and not what you don’t need. 
	- You can merge panels into other panels to create something resembling a browser with multiple tabs; or you can drag to the side, which places the panel adjacent to the panel you hovered over.
