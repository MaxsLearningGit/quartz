# General Tips

- Switch between Focus`ris:Focus3` mode (which includes imagery, but also subvocalization) when you're reading technical and dense matieral.
 - Switch to 2-4-6 mode or "speed reading mode"-- either using a pacer, rectangle mode, or the pacer w/ monitor method. 
		 - ❌No subvocalization besides 2-4-6
		 - ✅Make SOME pictures, just don't dwell on ALWAYS making them. Don't be afraid to be sparing with your mental markers.

### BOTTOM LINE: 
After you decided on what mode you want, STOP WORRYING ABOUT THAT PART--- and just worry about interpreting the text in front of you... Read RIGHT where your pointer/saccade is at, and soak in the information..
