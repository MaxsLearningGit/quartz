Building a second brain is a method around the premise that your brain is great at having ideas, but not at keeping track of them. This is a bit like the idea of "a mind like water" from the GTD philosophy, where capturing ideas elsewhere frees your mind up to make connections creatively and intuitively rather than getting bogged down in needing to remember things. A second brain is a system for capturing and storing ideas so that you can refer to them later.

Expecting our brains to capture, process, understand, remember, and use new ideas is like using a spoon as your only utensil. While technically possible, a few minutes of trying to use a spoon to eat steak will convince you there's got to be a better way. And there is.

Our minds are great at making intuitive leaps and finding connections between two seemingly disparate pieces of information. Our minds are also great at following systematic processes to arrive at a logical conclusion. What they're _not_ so great at is remembering information or processes in the first place. So why don't we outsource that?

There are plenty of digital tools that excel at storing information. Computers are far better at storage than we are.
