# Reversing stimulant tolerance: 9-Me-BC is the pinnacle. (Regeneration of dopaminergic neurons)

[May 2020 Update: I've written a comprehensive guide on stimulant tolerance reversal here and what I consider to be essentials as well as optionals.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y_8usEhGvx439m61u79Tpv-xjss9j75HNdrYtb_eCCo/edit?usp=drivesdk)

There's a lot of threads on /r/Nootropics and various forums like Longecity on how to reduce/reverse tolerance from longterm stimulant (ab)use especially from dopaminergics.

I've tried all of those substances (extended periods of abstinence, BPC-157, bromantane, memantine, uridine + alpha GPC + DHA (Mr. Happy Stack), NSI-189, phenylpiracetam, tianeptine, NMDA antagonists like agmatine and ketamine, etc). They all work to a certain extent, but nothing has worked better than 9-Me-BC. It regenerates dopaminergic neurons and there's a ton anecdotal evidence that people have been able to easily cut their AMPH dosage by half or more within a single week. I made a thread about it [here earlier to gather some experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8wyauf/restoring_dopaminergic_system_with_9mebc/) and I highly recommend reading [this thread](https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/70561-9-me-bc-regeneration-of-dopaminergic-neurons/page-1) as well on top of all the threads on /r/Nootropics.

[test](wow)

I've been using 15-30mg once a day in the mornings for only a week now and my 40mg Vyvanse dosage is back at full throttle. The magic is back - I'm literally back at stage 1 of [amphetamine the drug you love to hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/4i6550/amphetamine_the_drug_you_learn_to_hate/). It's as if I took it for the first time, and honestly I think I'd prefer dropping to 20mg now. I used to take 80-160mg Vyvanse for a while too so I can attest to the fact that 9-Me-BC works. It's very easy to source online and has solid nootropic benefits too. The only thing I haven't tried in my repertoire is microdosing stims for sensitization but I'm not willing to take the risk plus I'm fairly sure that it won't even work as explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/94o8ry/the_truth_myth_about_dopamine_sensitization_from/). As of right now, I plan to keep using 15mg 9-Me-BC daily and using 20-40mg Vyvanse once a week instead.

If I were to rank effectiveness on tolerance reversal and repairing subjective damage from continued amph (ab)use it would go: 

9-MBC >>> Bromantane > BPC-157 >>> the rest. Highly recommended, this stuff instantly erases withdrawals and reverses tolerance - what more could you ask for?

**Caveat:** I'm not a doctor, I'm merely relaying my personal experience. 9-MBC isn't that well studied (so isn't most other nootropics either to be honest) and it has some possible risks such as DNA damage with excessive sunlight exposure. Do your own research. I haven't found any other side effects, just positives. This stuff probably also reduces prolactin which is why is also has potent aphrodisiac properties.

**EDIT:**

<mark>Please read through the comments on the /r/Stims thread and all the other posts on Reddit + Longecity regarding this substance. Given its potentially potent MAOI activity, it should be avoided in conjunction with stimulants and other substances that directly release/inhibit reuptake of monoamines. This is best used to completely withdraw from stimulants and reset tolerance (on top of all the nootropic and healing benefits).</mark>

**Further summary of benefits:**

>• enhances mood

>• enhances cognition, learning and memory (both working and long term)

>• enhances spatial memory and the movements

>• neuroprotective (especially in the hippocampus and the midbrain, and against PD - parkinson's disease)

>• neuroregenerative (especially in the hippocampus and the midbrain, and against PD)

**Mechanism of Action**

>• up-regulates, differentiates and protects dopaminergic neurons, dendrites and synapses, especially in the substantia nigra of the midbrain and in the hippocampus [1][2][6][7]

>• increases dopamine synthesis [1][7]

>• increases neurotrophins/neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF, CDNF [6], GDNF, SHH [5]) and decrease apoptic signals [6] (like caspase-3) [2]

>• decreases inflammation, preventing microglia proliferation and chemokine release [4], protecting against lipopolysaccharide toxicity [5] and reducing LDH [2][6] (lactate dehydrogenase) [7] reduces α-synuclein [4][5], the aggregation of which form insoluble fibrils (like lewy bodies), one of the causes of some neurodegenerative disorders, like PD and AD (alzheimer's disease)
increase TH [6] (tyrosine hydroxylase) expression and its transcription factors, and interacts with tyrosine kinases [4][5][7]. TH converts L-tyrosine to L-Dopa, needed for the synthesis of the catecholamines, especially dopamine

>• MAO-B inhibition [3], preventing the formation of neurotoxic substances, like DOPAC (from the dopamine metabolization), 6-OH-DA (oxydopamine), and MPDP⁺/MPP⁺ (from MPTP), the major cause of dopaminergic neurons death

>• increases/protects/recovers the NADH dehydrogenase (or "complex I" [6] which catalyzes the transfer of electrons between NADH and Co-Q10), enhancing the mithocondrial respiration chain [7]

>• increase ATP [6]

**Side Effects**

>• photo-sensitivity (DNA damage after UVA rays exposure) [8][9][10]

>• dopamine neurotoxicity with quantities over the maximum recommended [6] **(anyone know what this amount might be?)**

├─ Predator nutrition has it (and its where I got it), however they refuse to send me a COA which makes me have strong doubts and purity and as you can imagine im wary of the DNA damage effect.

It did seem to have an effect on me btw, certain has a dopaminergic flow state feel to it, Id rate it superior compared to methylphenidate but hey thats just me. Methylphenidate makes me feel like a happy clown with no reason on top of its stim like action. 9mebc was just a calming flow state for me, felt good I admit. Done both 15 and 30mg and I actually like 15mg better.

All the positive and negatives put a side, there should be more research done on this and possibly looking into othe r carbolines which have similar effects without the possible risks.

├───── My god take a properly heavy antioxidant stack if you are going to do that.  That is literally damaging.  Shoveling down a bunch of vitamins A/C/E, ubiquinol, ALA, PQQ, liposomal reduced-form glutathione, fisetin, d-limonene to fix the absorption issues, etc. are the only things that will protect you from rusting out your own brain.  Always take huge loads of antioxidants if you are going to use potent stimulants in general.

Anyway Jiaogulan is one of the only things I know that can literally re-grow dopamine neurons, so if anything can save you now, that might be it.  Here are some links; Bromantane might help too but it's more for just upregulating dopamine synthesis and less for outright restoration of neurite structure:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9ajfcy/reversing\_stimulant\_tolerance\_9mebc\_is\_the/e4wyqyz](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9ajfcy/reversing_stimulant_tolerance_9mebc_is_the/e4wyqyz)

If you are more desperate and have the money, you could try Cerebrolysin and Cortexin.  They do work subQ fwiw; IM is not strictly necessary.  Cerebrolysin even works orally to a limited extent (yes I have tried it; tastes like old bacon; I regret nothing).  There are also a bunch of other things I know that upregulate BDNF/NGF, though I don't know if they would do so intensely enough to help at this point.  Just search this sub for everything you can find that upregulates BDNF and NGF.  And take a bunch of fish oil and antioxidants even now if you want to have a chance at fixing this.

One other thing, though I am hesitant to recommend this because of some other forms of it that don't work and were sold by con artists, but you could also look into hydrogen-gas-infused water.  It's a very strong antioxidant.  Avoid the tablets; some are fraudulent.  Just use an electrolysis bottle; check Amazon for the ones with the best reviews; shouldn't cost more than about $150-200.  It produces an almost immediate and noticeable positive effect on alertness and alleviates many of the negative effects of sleep deprivation-- which are largely oxidative in nature.  There are many dozens of papers about it showing huge benefits in all kinds of oxidative and ischemic conditions (heart attacks, strokes, certain types of liver and kidney damage, sepsis, etc.).  I have no idea whether it would help from longer-term damage but I am guessing you probably want to know about everything that could possibly have a chance. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)

├── To chime in a bit on this:All dopaminergic stimulants increase dopamine levels.  Dopamine catabolism via MAO (but not COMT) produces oxidative intermediaries.  The effects are worsened when dopamine leaks into the cytosol and outside the synapse into the extracellular matrix, which can happen to a greater extent at high doses or (to your point) with use of certain infamously overpowered stimulants.

Consistent with your claim, there are no convincing studies I have seen claiming genuine damage to dopaminergic neurites or neuron cell bodies from ordinary d-amphetamine or mixed amphetamine salts at human-equivalent doses below at least \~1000mg per day.  The few that did show genuine degradation of neurites or outright neuron death used multiple >1-gram-human-equivalent doses per day for weeks on test animals.  Hyperthermia and dehydration intensify oxidative stress and damage.

What does happen is a reduction in the density of dopamine receptors and vesicles, which can persist for several weeks.  But that is simply the molecular cause of tolerance itself and it eventually normalizes again.

d-methamphetamine, on the other hand, is toxic at even very low doses.  (Tangentially: so is MDMA.  Meanwhile, I have seen no evidence that l-methamphetamine is toxic, and its action appears largely limited to norepinephrine.)  Apart from the broader receptor binding profile and much stronger affinities relative to ordinary d-amphetamine, supposedly its metabolism (to d-amphetamine itself) is quite metabolically costly.  Former methamphetamine addicts, unlike former recreational users of ordinary amphetamine, show a pattern of what appears to be essentially permanent impairment after discontinuation-- minimal improvement after even 6 months. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─── Do people who have taken fenfluramine for decades suffer functional iimpairment?  IIRC fenfluramine is more neurotoxic than MDMA.  There should be plenty of data ... ⏤ by *apodicity* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── Interesting question.  I had not been aware-- I have mainly heard of fenfluramine via scandals concerning harmful cardiac effects arising from 5-HT2B agonism.

There seems to be some uncertainty in the literature about any potentially neurotoxic effects of fenfluramine, with the usual 'oh it depleted <neurotransmitter> so it must be toxic' nonsense being too common-- https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/419513

And it does look like the abstract mentions only 'markers' for serotonin axons.  It is best to see direct histological confirmation to establish that any actual damage occurs.  https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/418047

Looking for any direct evidence of structural damage like methamphetamine at dopamine terminals or MDMA for serotonin neurite integrity....

Ok.  Yes.  Fenfluramine is almost certainly neurotoxic to serotonin neurons, particularly around the axons.  I found the full text of the paper and there is a side-by-side comparison of chemically labeled tissue samples showing overwhelming reductions in serotonin axons many months later, extremely similar to the slides I have seen from MDMA effects on experimental animals.  No idea what dose was used though.

In the Wikipedia section "Adverse effects," there _do_ seem to be persistent behavioral alterations consistent with damage.  That said, the references are all to book chapters, none of which seem particularly directly related, so it will take a bit of time to find the actual statements made.

And yes, it does appear to be potentially at fault in causing persistent psychiatric problems for at least some people who used it.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9829290/ ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├───── The studies by (IIRC) Nichols/Ricuarte used ludicrously high (certainly by comparison to actual human use) doses intravenously.  The results were almost guaranteed by the amphetamine-like mechanism of running the transporter in reverse.   ⏤ by *apodicity* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├────── So where's the class action lawsuit for all that neurotoxicity in all the people who took phen/fen for YEARS?  *tumbleweed rolls by* It's a joke.  Yeah, it's true: if you bang high doses of MDMA with gusto, it's coming for you! 

I think some of the original data from the early 2000s was also straight up fabricated.  I forget which researcher--one of the prominent ones.  Gave methamphetamine and called it MDMA.  No, really, I'm pretty sure this happened. ⏤ by *apodicity* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─────── Heard about this.

Merely running the transporter backward does not necessarily cause toxicity though.

But yes I agree that huge overdoses of many otherwise largely innocuous substances can cause damage.  Consider Tylenol or caffeine or I mean really anything.

Likely not much class action because hard to prove.  'Ok send us a brain biopsy' doubtful.  Whereas fenfluramine-induced valvular dysfunction is visible in medical imaging. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

├─── It doesn't get you anywhere to compare meth addicts to recreational users of amphetamine.  That impairment is due to myriad factors, though certainly neurophysiological damage could be one!  There is a huge upside to methamphetamine, BTW--2-3x less cardiotoxic per d-amphetamine equivalent.  I don't have time to write more now, which sucks because I was happy to get something genuinely interesting in my inbox.  Spoiler:. you're basically correct.  Some nuances but tis good

If you want to read some high-grade sh1te, check out what Dr. Jozef Knoll is doing these days.  He is Mr. propargylamine lulz, u know, starting with selegiline in the 60s.

Main reason I don't take meth is because my Dr. says he isn't comfortable with the possibility of increased risk of serotonergic neurotoxity given I take a non-elective, irreversible MAOI.  He said it's not like DANGER DANGER so much that he _knows_ d-amphetamine doesn't do it.  It simply can't.

Then he said "And d-amphetamine has been in use so much longer!". It's true :. meth was invented like 30 years later lulz.

##### For reversing stimulant tolerance, I have only found 3 compounds to be effective, but in my particular situation (see below) I would instead rank them as:

high-dose Jiaogulan extract (410-820mg @ 98% gypenosides NusaPure) \~= Bromantane (50-100mg 1x-2x/day) > 9-me-BC (15mg Hydrapharm)

HOWEVER: I am limited to low doses of 9-me-BC because I already use other MAO-B inhibitors and have an inherently inefficient form of MAO-A genetically.  I can literally feel the effects of excessive MAO inhibition beyond that, and it is not fun-- this can happen to me from using more than \~30-50mg of Polygala extract as well, or too much Scutellaria baicalensis extract, and I found 9-Me-BC even at 15mg was pushing into similar issues.  I am also nervous about the risk of synth by-products, as certain other closely related beta-carbolines (e.g. 2,9-dime-BC) are extremely potent neurotoxins similar to MPP+, so my experimentation has been limited to one particular source and I may not be able to trust others or future batches without similarly extensive prior info.  This biases my results in favor of the other two by both dosing limits and supplier concerns.

It also seems as though Cerebrolysin has some potential benefit, but this is difficult to disentangle from its overall energy-improving and restorative effects more generally (e.g. it also seems to act as a fairly strong antidepressant and sleep aid)-- so I am hesitant to include it above, though it does appear useful on some level.

EDIT: using 100mg phenylpiracetam once in the evening (skipping a d-amp booster) also greatly resets tolerance at D1/D2/D3 receptors by the next morning. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─ very interesting, especially the part where you mentioned that jiaogulan could actually re-grow  dopamine neurons! where can I read more about that, do you have any studies that are worth reading? also,would you say the jiaogulan extract has a permanent effect? or do you need to take it constantly to keep the effects? 

&#x200B; ⏤ by *stimul4nt* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├─ Great post, thanks for chiming in. Never heard of Jiaogulan before, I'm surprised an extract like that surpassed bromantane for you. Did you try BPC-157, and was your bromantane taken orally? 

15mg 9-MBC is still nothing to sneeze at, it has very noticeable effects for me orally. It would be nice if Hydrapharm/PN would provide a CoA because it is indeed risky. Hopefully IRC can get some back in stock.

How does excessive MAO inhibition feel subjectively to you? My genetic testing also reveals MAO-A and B enzyme issues (heterozygous). ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├── I've used BPC-157 orally, sublingually, and subQ.  First two noticed a mild improvement in mood and general sense of well-being, and some improvement to old sports injuries.  But subQ I've successfully used it to heal tissue damage.  It's amazing.  I didn't seem to see any significant reduction in stimulant tolerance, but I may have simply not been using it regularly enough to notice.  It's a bit pricy to use regularly.

Bromantane usually sublingual.  Sometimes I am impatient or busy and just swallow it though.

2,9-dime-BC as a synth by-product frankly frightens me.  Even a relatively small impurity could be enough to cause significant damage to dopamine neurons, possibly at a level too low to be reported in user comments until it is too late.  If it is any consolation, 9-me-BC itself is apparently somewhat protective against MPP+ neurotoxicity, so it would probably protect against its own potential impurities to some degree as well.  Still not worth the risk of trying any other batch to me.  Sooner or later some synth shop *will* mess up, and there will be 'frozen substance users' in emergency rooms again.

Excessive MAO inhibition on stimulants feels similar to getting overheated from exertion in a hot environment while using potent stimulants.  Very dry mouth, some degree of tachycardia, sweating, oily skin, hypertension, total inability to sleep, greatly extended duration of stimulant effects, intense extreme focus to an undesirable level (getting 'locked on' to a given task and unable to switch).

If it gets severe (this happened to me once when I foolishly tried 100+mg of Polygala while on stimulants, forgetting I had already knocked out almost all of my MAO-B with selegiline and it would end up 100% targeted against MAO-A), then do NOT use propranolol for this; it will make the situation worse supposedly.  I ended up using a bunch of arginine, citrulline, PDE5 inhibitors, and guanfacine to block the hypertension.  I also used GABA and picamilon to partly alleviate the overstimulation, and a high dose of 5-HTP to deflect some of the excessive dopamine signaling to serotonin instead.  All in all, a somewhat disturbing experience, though ultimately treatable.  Ended up wasting several hours unfortunately.

Tl;Dr don't mix stimulants with anything that inhibits both MAO enzymes too strongly (particularly MAO-A since MAO-B mostly only handles dopamine) or you may have a fairly bad day. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

├─── They got stock back so I pulled the trigger. How did 410-820mg @ 98% gypenosides NusaPure feel subjectively, does it completely replace dopaminergics during withdrawal or did it simply help reverse tolerance? 

I'm finding that 15-30mg 9-Me-BC is producing tolerance so I'll likely stop using it after a few weeks. 

Excessive MAO inhibition sounds awful. ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── It does not feel as strongly stimulating.  More restorative, subjectively.  Kind of 'refreshing' in a way.  Difficult to describe.  It does have some mild stimulatory and wakefulness-promoting effects.  But it does not substitute quite as much as e.g. Bromantane for stronger stimulation.  Also no jitters like caffeine, and no apparent stimulant side effects.  The health-related effects have more to do with promoting dopaminergic neuron upkeep, repair, and restoration against oxidative stress (including outright regrowth after extreme oxidative damage from lab standard neurotoxins in cell plate and rodent experiments; the photomicrographs are astonishing).

For immediate substitution and tolerance-reversal from dopaminergic stimulants, with stimulant discontinuation, I usually use this type of Jiaogulan extract at a rate of 410-820mg/dose up to 2x per day, in combination with Bromantane 50-100mg 2x per day.  The bromantane can be tapered at a rate of about 100mg/week.  In Russia they use 2x50-100mg/day for 3-4 weeks to treat 'asthenia' which is basically just dopamine insufficiency in my view.

For on-line tolerance reduction with simultaneous stimulant continuation (I only realized I could do this fairly recently), I have been able to just take Jiaogulan extract 410mg and Bromantane 50-75mg at bedtime with no noticeable impairment in sleep quality.  After about a week or so of this, I find that my stimulant tolerance has been significantly reduced.  You could probably keep it up for another week or two beyond that if it was needed.  I am not sure how my simultaneous use of selegiline affects this, granted; I may be accumulating less oxidative stress than would otherwise be expected.

Both can be discontinued abruptly with little apparent rebound.  If you still have some lingering stimulant tolerance in the first place, you might notice halting the Bromantane in particular, but personally in one experiment after e.g. 2 full weeks of stimulant discontinuation with Bromantane taper-down from 2x100mg/day to 2x25mg/day I noticed no apparent withdrawal effects.  People with outright stimulant addictions should maybe consider trying this if they want to quit.  Personally, I just have ADHD and find this helps my medication stay effective without full medication holidays (and all the original and rebound-amplified ADHD symptoms they entail..).

I did not try 9-me-BC long enough to notice much apparent tolerance.  I was pretty skittish about it because of the MAO issue and the potential tail risk of neurotoxic synth byproducts, improbable as it may be. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├───── Is it ok to take 820mg of that 98% jiaogulun with low dose (20mg Vyvanse) amphetamine? ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├────── You might feel a bit overstimulated.  Try 410mg (one capsule) first.  It depends.  Personally I tend to do only one when my medication is active, or two at night or on medication holidays.  But it is really going to depend on your degree of stimulant sensitivity and possibly receptor polymorphisms. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─────── Interesting, the jiaogulan seems to make me acutely lethargic but that may be due to lowered blood pressure and blood sugar levels. ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──────── Then it sounds like you should be able to try 2 capsules without too much risk of excessive stimulation.

I assume you have ADHD too?  Personally I can sleep straight through 40mg Vyvanse.  It's very relaxing, especially for the first hour and after about 5 hours.  But it also potentiates essentially every other stimulating substance.

Likewise I can and often do sleep through 820mg of nearly pure Jiaogulan gypenosides.

Caffeine on the other hand always wakes me up-- it acts directly on adenosine receptors instead of indirectly through catecholamines.  Modafinil and its derivatives also tend to be more eugeroic for me than amphetamines, I assume probably due to their putative effects on the orexin system.  (Oddly fl-modafinil is the only one I am not apparently allergic to.  Ominous.  I stay well away from the others at this point.) ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├───────── I've never gotten an official diagnosis for it but my PCP rx'd me Vyvanse for fatigue issues. Yeah, the jia feels rather relaxing and taking more seems to make it worse so I may just stick with 410mg for now.  ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├─────── By the way, do you feel that uridine or cordyceps have a place in recovering from dopaminergics? The former raises D2 density, the latter upregulates a subtype of TH.

I'm really trying to make bromantane work with amphetamine, I'm using it for its work capacity benefits for training (lifting). Do you think 5-25mg bromantane would be good enough to keep TH upregulated while providing the other benefits? ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──────── Usually on an empty stomach at night.

25mg minimum.  50mg likely better.  See what effects you notice though. ⏤ by *__phoenix13* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├───────── So for dealing with [DAWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome#Dopamine_agonist_protracted_withdrawal) from a DA agonist such as l-dopa or pramipexole, you'd still use the above strategy (bromantane, 9-MBC, jiagulan, BPC-157) or would something inherently change? I wouldn't think so since it would just be a more severe case of TH downregulation. ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├────────── deleted 
├───────── Yeah even 25mg bromantane gives bad sides with amphs but it's only for a couple hours so I'll just deal with it. I also seem to be very sensitive to jiaogulan's hypotensive effects.

By the way, do you not feel that taking l-tyrosine prior to amphs makes it kind of jittery/uneasy? It feels dirty to me when taken immediately prior. Also, you should give magnesium l-threonate a shot if you haven't - it's definitely restorative.

Edit: what do you get out of 7,8-DHF? I have some from ND and I only tried it once, just made me anxious IIRC. ⏤ by *full_silver* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

Any luck with using Jiaogulan to fulfill you needs? did it reduce your tolerance?

If not, what have you been using instead to ween off the tolerance for vyvanse?

You are taking a similar dose to mine, which is 30mg. And I do not wish to increase it. I do a lot of things to reduce its tolerance such as, eating a lot of fish, veggies, and no carbs. Jogging 30-50 minutes every day almost. My stack is quite simple too as I only take vitamin D/C, coq10, magnesium threaonate/glycinate, and sometimes NA-R-ALA. However, I am looking to expand it a with something that will really be useful to decrease tolerance. I tired quickly of having 30 bottles of noots, so I do not wish to add so many thing like phoenix (the guy above has done).

Regenerative therapy in experimental parkinsonism: mixed population of differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, rather than magnetically sorted and enriched dopaminergic …

Debasmita Tripathy, Poonam Verma, Dominic N Nthenge‐Ngumbau, Meghna Banerjee, Kochupurackal P Mohanakumar

CNS neuroscience & therapeutics 20 (8), 717-727, 2014

Aim

The objective of the study was to develop regenerative therapy by transplanting varied populations of dopaminergic neurons, differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) in the striatum for correcting experimental parkinsonism in rats.

Methods

mES differentiated by default for 7 days in serum‐free media (7D), or by enhanced differentiation of 7D in retinoic acid (7R), or dopaminergic neurons enriched by manual magnetic sorting from 7D (SSEA−) were characterized and transplanted in the ipsilateral striatum of 6‐hydroxydopamine …

Long term L-DOPA treatment causes production of 6-OHDA in the mouse striatum: Involvement of hydroxyl radical

Anupom Borah, Kochupurackal P Mohanakumar

Annals of Neurosciences 16 (4), 160-165, 2010

Background:

L-DOPA (3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), the precursor of dopamine (DA) still remains the mainstay drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). L-DOPA is not well regulated at the dopaminergic neurons due to excessive DA production from the anti-parkinsonian drug, it has been generally believed that several cytotoxic molecules could be generated in the brain following activation by dopaminomimetics and DA catabolism inhibitors.

Purpose:

The present study examines the production of 6-OHDA in the striatum of mice treated sub-acutely with L-DOPA, and investigates the possible mechanism of 6-OHDA production from DA.

Methods:

Male adult Balb/c mice were treated with different doses of L-DOPA/carbidopa combination (25, 250 and 500/2.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, po) or vehicle for 7 days and 6-OHDA levels were analyzed in the striatum at 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after the last dose of the drug.

Results:

We report here that prolonged L-DOPA treatment in mice causes significant elevation in 6-OHDA production from 1–6 h after the drug treatment, which is dependent on the dose of L-DOPA administered. Dopamine utilization was evident from the reduced levels of its presence in the FAD system following 6-OHDA production.

Conclusion:

These results point to an inherent hazard of long-term administration of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease patients

##### Based on this diagram and description the congestion of 9-Me-BC and amphetamines or Dopamine reuptake(or releasers) inhibitors like Ritalin and various others, might not be effective. 9MeBC is said to go through the Dopamine transporter to have it's main effect on dopaminergic neuro-outgrowth, the DRI* or DRA(amp) would block the transporter therefore blocking the 9MeBC's entrance path negating the the main desired effect(the purpose of using this rather than a different neuron restorative stack). I think a tolerance is absolutely needed in order to achieve the highest amount of effects. *lesser known DRI/dra include Zoloft, skullcap extract, tea, etc., High dose venlefaxine, wellbutrin, modafil, flowering quince benzatropine even.
