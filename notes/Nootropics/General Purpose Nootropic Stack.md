# General Purpose Nootropic Stack

I've been using nootropics for 6 years or so, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with lesser-known noots, and I've never really asked for advice about it. This stack is entirely built from online research and my own personal experience. My hope is that, in discussing it, I can help people improve theirs while also generating valuable feedback about my own.
  
**Goals:** Learning, Creativity, Memory, Focus  
**Criteria:** Low health risk, obtainable in the US
  
  
**NOOTROPICS**

* **Piracetam** - 800mg, 5 times/week: I haven't tried other racetams, but I've also never really felt the need to. Piracetam is my first nootropic; it feels comfortable to me in the same way an old sweater feels even if you wear it for days on end. Biggest improvements are creativity and clarity. What stands out to me the most is my ability to "find words" almost immediately, ones that would normally escape me. It's a subtle effect, but a useful one.  *Issues:* I don't take a choline supplement, and I do notice myself getting irritable near the end of the week every now and then. However, I can usually recognize what's happening without letting it affect my social or work life. I tried CDP-Choline when I first started taking it, but I didn't really notice an improvement (it actually gave me headaches), so I stopped.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)** - 1000mg, 5 times/week: While I don't take choline to supplement my racetam, ALCAR on its own seems to significantly reduce the irritability factor, such that I consider it as a requirement for piracetam as I'm sure a lot of people consider their choline source. It also seems to help with fatigue, and, strangely enough, chronic pain. I used to work in a warehouse where I would go home sore every day, and the difference in taking this supplement was night and day.  
*Issues:* None.
* **Modafinil** - 100mg, 3-4 times/week: Modafinil is a focus and endurance supplement. It's my "cheat" for making it through the end of the week without crashing and burning, even if I skimp on sleep due to caffeine. My job also involves some repetitive tasks, and moda lets me focus on them without growing restless or making too many mistakes. It's also, perhaps most usefully, incredible for reading or doing research. However, it can be a double-edged sword.  
*Issues:* While I notice I make fewer mistakes on more repetitive, simpler tasks, I sometimes miss obvious or glaring errors on more complex ones if I rush at all. On moda, I have this saying (to myself) that "things take as long as they take." Moda can also be ruthless when it comes to sleep; I always have to "pay back" my debt at the end of the week, which usually involves full on hibernation on Saturday. Thirdly, it increases my anxiety and makes me somewhat "slow" in conversation since I'm focusing on every single word. Thankfully, the next one counteracts this to some degree.  
* **Phenibut** - 500mg, 1-2 times/week: I take phenibut for something I've always struggled with—social anxiety. It's by far the best drug I've ever taken for it. Without it, I feel inundated by values, concerns, and fears, no matter how stupid or illogical, reaching up at my conscious brain for attention all at the same time, crowding together and clouding my judgment. With it, though, all of those unimportant things just fall away, allowing me to focus on the things I truly care about. It really helps me cut through the noise.  
*Issues:* If I'm not careful, I can turn into an asshole, although I might be the only one who thinks this. I've also read of people building a tolerance, which concerns me slightly as I've recently upped from once to twice a week.  
* **Caffeine (Red Bull Sugarfree)** - 160-240mg, 5-6 times/week: The classic. With the consistency that I drink these, I've considered switching to caffeine pills, but on some level I don't trust myself not to abuse them. I've also tried to supplement caffeine with l-theanine, but it just makes me sleepy.  
*Issues:* I build a tolerance fairly quickly, so I can't have it every day. I once went through a period where my tolerance was so strong that I would get a 30 minute rush and then immediately feel tired. I'm better at moderating these days.  
* **Lion's Mane** - 1000mg, 5 times/week: This is the newest addition to my stack, so I don't have a lot of personal experience here; I added it this week because of some good things I've read recently.  
*Issues:* I don't have anything negative to say so far. I've been as productive and clear-headed as ever since starting it.


**OTHER SUPPLEMENTS**

* **D-Ribose** - 1500mg, 5 times/week: I started taking this recently to help combat fatigue. Apparently it's a member of the "awesome foursome" of heart health, along with L-Carnitine, CoQ10, and Magnesium. I haven't really felt a difference yet, but it could just be very subtle.
* **Flaxseed Oil** - 1400mg, 5 times/week: Omega 3-6-9. Basically Fish Oil but makes me feel a little better about where it comes from. I notice a slight boost to energy, but it also seems to give me significantly healthier skin. Huh.
* **Multivitamin (Kirkland Adult Multivitamin Gummies)** - 7 times/week: Gummy multivitamins are the best multivitamins. They're also the only ones I remember to take on the weekends, because they're so delicious.
* **Vitamin D3** - 2000IU, 5 times/week: Multivitamin only contains 800IU of the D, which doesn't cut it in winter in Seattle.


**MY QUESTIONS**

1. What's the best source for moda in the US now that modafinilcat is dead??
2. Should I try taking a choline supplement again? I wonder if piracetam + ALCAR + choline would be preferable to what I'm currently doing.
3. Other racetams? I've been wanting to try coluracetam, but I only have experience taking capsules, and I can only find coluracetam in powder form.
4. Caffeine pills vs. energy drinks? I suppose caffeine pills wouldn't ruin my teeth.
5. Anyone have experience with Lion's Mane? What should I expect?
6. Is D-Ribose just a waste of my time? Or should I add CoQ10 and Magnesium for maximum benefit?
7. Anything else that seems right up my alley?

## Comments

##### 1. Afinilexpress is a reliable source

2. Everyone's experience varies in regards to how much choline you need so you'll just have to see

3. Colouracetam has been amazing in aiding my anxiety along with improving my cognitive skills. It also gives me what I perceive as "HD Vision"

4. Caffeine pills, you should give Theacrine pills a try!

5.  Lion's mane is sooo good

6. Never tried D-Ribose, but CoQ10 and Magnesium is prime in my daily stack.

7. Pramiracetam has done wonders for me in regards to learning material at a faster rate. Oxiracetam & phenylpiracetam helps me with performance on the days I need a boost. Aniracetam helps me creatively along with verbal fluency(I advise you to up your choline intake if you were to receive a headache from adding these racetams to your stack.). If you haven't already, [[Ashwagandha]] is reaaaally good. ⏤ by *gtx_1080p* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─ * I had some concerns about AfinilExpress; apparently some people got their CC information stolen. Maybe I'll bitcoin it and hope for the best?
* How do you take coluracetam?
* Theacrine looks promising. I'll look into it!
* I read stuff about Ashwagandha all the time. Maybe it's finally time I give it a shot. In regard to the racetams - if you had to choose only one, which would it be?

Thank you! ⏤ by *blacknix* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── Hm I usually use bitcoin so I never run into the CC issue(+ 20% off discount!). I take my coluracetam sublingual. People respond differently, but generally Ashwagandha helps with anxiety and a lot of clarity of mind. Can't go wrong with natural herbs! ⏤ by *gtx_1080p* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
