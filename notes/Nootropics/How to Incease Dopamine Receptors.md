# How to increase dopamine receptors

So just to be clear, I’m looking to increase the RECEPTORS which accept dopamine, not increase dopamine itself, does anyone know how?

##### I think this article covers options. [https://nootropicsprofessor.com/how-to-upregulate-dopamine-over-the-long-term/](https://nootropicsprofessor.com/how-to-upregulate-dopamine-over-the-long-term/)

That was a good question. I learned something.

>*You can find hundreds of articles on “how to boost dopamine”, but this is only half the story. In reality, it’s not as simple as merely boosting a neurotransmitter and expecting a positive result.*

**Methods of Upregulation (with 20 reference studies at bottom)**

1. Uridine - By preventing overstimulation of striatal DA receptors, uridine may help promote more stable and consistent levels of circulating DA in the brain.
2. CDP-Choline - The exact mechanism by which cdp-choline upregulates DA is unclear. However, CDP-choline does provide neuroprotection for dopaminergic neurons7, and this protection play a key role.
3. Forskolin - has been noted to upregulate DA receptor densities quite significantly. In the first study I will be referencing, supplementation was shown to modify two unique DA receptors: D2L, and D2S.
4. Inositol - (I don't think worth considering)

I have been keeping a gratitude journal for the majority of the last 6 months, during a particularly difficult period in my life, and gratitude journalling has has helped me so, so, so much through realising the abundance of gifts I have been blessed with in life.

Thank you for that insight. I didn't know. Found the paper. Oddly the choline uptake reaction for rats was different.

├── Agreed. AND exercise is the only thing that moves your lymphatic system. Blood has heart. Lymph network is 3-5 times larger and stagnates without motion/exercise. Significant issue as allopathic doctors never account for lymphatic buildup. They rarely know how to address or treat. ⏤ by *herbalist65pete* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─── That’s interesting. Can you go more info the negative side effects of lymphatic buildup? I’m guilty of sitting too much but I just bought a treadmill. ⏤ by *DopeAppleBroheim* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├──── Any search on lymphedema will likely explain better than myself.  But one of the main things it leads towards is when the lymphatic system is no longer filtering waste from blood effectively and the lymphatic trash, it's trying to help process out of the body, is stagnant. Then the toxic waste can go back into blood and from there, travel carte blanche to wherever it wishes. And the lymph no longer can effectively transfer nutrients to blood or be able to accept the blood's toxins. Tumors and cancers are some of the more severe outcomes as cellular toxicity builds up in body and organs start to slow down.

On the **extreme and backend** of lymphedema, I've seen legs that look like elephantis. Skin necrosis escalated rapidly starting from ankles up to knees. Joints swell because blood flow stagnants, lymph stagnants, cellular waste just continues to build up....it's a very ugly path.

Lymphatic buildup is a slow killer because often it's created by a lifestyle pattern that enables it. It doesn't just jump out at you. It's like an older car that suddenly starts to have a lot of little issues, sometimes big ones. Sooner or later you're also likely to start seeing co-morbid diseases due to your lymph system. But if you go to the doctor, they'll treat your hbp, your diabetes, your excess weight, your depression....but they will NOT address the lymphatic system.

And while they prescribe meds for all these pills, your kidneys start to slow down and it can't filter like it use to because of all the metabolites and metabolic pathways affected by chemical drugs, accumulating to kidney, oxidative stress and excessive workload that is backing up.  Kidney function from that day forth will never be the same unless drastic changes are made. Let alone your liver's extra work. Maybe that's when fatty liver issues kick in.

It's just a gradual start to a quick finish when the lymphatic system finally has enough and starts breaking down because it was ignored.

So the negative side of lymphatic buildup? Go to your nearest waste facility and start dumping a garbage can a week in your front room.  I mean, our body is a temple so the analogy is quite fitting. And keep dumping. Unless that shit is removed, that room itself is going to be a toxic nightmare and corrode anything near it.

URIDINE in the study every one is referring to is able to lower you dar count and exacerbated the signaling of the receptor.
Caveat the animals were on amphetamine 

So listen lowering volume and differentiation then exacerbating a response to drug has been implicated in things like addiction. Personally I just read science but that’s sensitization in my book.

I’d theorize having more substrate for secondary messages would likely contribute and no direct interaction between the purine and the receptors besides that they are suceptable to the phospholipid membrane.

├── Did a 20 day treatment. While on it i felt a solid moodlift through the whole 20 days. More motivated as well, and more notably orgasm intensity was 2x the usual, many also report increased libido.
Not to mention, my focus on school tasks was insanely good, it actually made me think that my usual self has adhd lol.

The effects for me did not seem permanent, as i stopped it and started wearing down my dopamine system again, i seemed to go back to somewhat my normal state after 3-4 months. This was like 1-2 months ago and im actually starting a new cycle very soon. 

Keep in mind, some of the effects are permanent, for example, it regenerates dopamine neurons for instance, this effect is permanent until u somehow end up destroying the neuron again (like with abuse of stimulants, expecially meth). 

It does also seem to be permanent for people that was suffering heavy lack of dopamine, like with anhedonia. U dont go back into anhedonia again afterwards. So what it seems like to me is that if it fixes something, its permanent, but if it enhances something, like focus, drive etc, general mood over baseline, it seems to go back after some time off.

├──── > Yeah so that’s what I’m looking for, I was considering ADHD meds, but actually they can wear down your receptors even more.

In my personal experience, I haven't found this to be the case.

Provided you *have* ADHD, your dopamine receptors are probably getting *under*-stimulated, so a correctly-calibrated dose of (ideally extended-release) ADHD meds will just raise that stimulation level to a normal one, rather than going past that to a stimulation level that could cause downregulation.

Sure, stimulants have a few-hour withdrawal period when they wear off where you have temporarily-low striatal dopamine. But that's not receptor downregulation. Sleep it off and you're fine and ready to take them again the next day, with long-term use provoking no decrease in effectiveness. (For most people. A minority of people do habituate to it, but we aren't actually sure of the mechanism for that.)

Now, of course, if you use too much, or if you use the stronger stimulant cousins of the ADHD meds, then sure, you'll get downregulation, or even excitotoxicity. The dose makes the poison. ⏤ by *derefr* (↑ 8/ ↓ 0)

├────── To be clear, I said that for a minority of people ADHD meds gradually decrease in their effectiveness, and then turning around and *using a higher dose of the medication to get the effect back* is what causes long-term problems.

If you just *don't do that* — i.e. if you're willing to say "well, the meds didn't work at a normal dose, so rather than upping the dose, I'll give up on them and try something else" — *then* ADHD meds should be completely safe to try as a way to solve your problem, no matter who you are. Either they work at a safe dose, or they don't; if they don't, at least you know that, and nothing bad happened. ⏤ by *derefr* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├──────── > Over time you should regulate to them, so the feeling becomes imperceptible. / The amount of stim in ADHD meds can be incredibly minimal to fairly minimal at the most.

Well, yeah. That's what I meant by "effective."

To be clear, I take ADHD meds every day. There's no high or anything, but the "feeling" is very perceptible, not in its presence, but in its absence. Which is to say, the feeling of *having ADHD* — the brain fog, the loss of short-term memory, the inability to make decisions, etc. — is *intensely* perceptible, and so it's very clear when those symptoms *go away*.

It's also very clear when they come back, every evening when the meds wear off. (I take Vyvanse; it metabolizes through me in roughly 12-14 hours.)

"Effectiveness" is measured, to me, by how much the symptoms of *having* ADHD go away. It would be pretty obvious to me if my meds stopped having an effect — because I'd never start being able to focus that day!

(There's also more direct physiologically-observable effects, though. Having "enough" dopamine decreases joint inflammation, while having "not-enough" dopamine increases it. So, as a person who generally has inflammatory problems, I can also notice the drugs kicking in and wearing off by how ache-y I am.)

> Even your use of 'normal' dose seems off the mark, there is no normal dose.

Sorry, by a "normal" dose I meant "dose that leads to a striatal dopamine level that has been found to match that of neurotypical people." I.e., a *normalizing* dose — but *normalizing* in the sense of normalizing your brain's messenger-chemical balance to match that of the average human's; *not* necessarily in terms of treating your symptoms. (To be clear, this isn't something we can directly measure in [living] humans. But we first can measure it in rats [with brain biopsies], and then deduce a formula that uses a human's body mass and age [proxy for blood-brain barrier strength] to predict what dose of a given stimulant *should* be required to cause the release of a given PPM of dopamine.)

But the thing is, you can have the right amount of striatal dopamine and still end up having ADHD, because the breakdown in your reward system can lay elsewhere (e.g. your dopamine receptors not working correctly, or being competitively antagonized by something; or some downline suppressive effect from excess serotonin or histamine or something.)

And my point was that, in *that* situation — when you've put enough drug in you that, if there *was* a bottleneck in the dopamine-releasing phase in the sequence, then it'd almost-definitely have been put right — but it still isn't doing for you what it does for most people with ADHD — then you *shouldn't keep going past that level*, because what you're doing at that point, by getting *supra-neurotypical* levels of dopamine released into the brain, is almost-certainly going to cause long-term damage to your brain. Having supra-neurotypical levels of dopamine in the brain is precisely what makes shooting meth both addictive, and destructive to braincells.

Yes, it's hard to determine (without a series of lumbar punctures) what dose is dopamine-normalizing for a given person's brain. Some people have abnormally-strong BBBs. But there _is_ such a level, even if you can't know what it is. And there's a reason for the commonly-manufactured dosage range of ADHD meds: the upper limit of that range is the ceiling dose for ~99.995% of people. If you're taking more than that, then you're almost certainly doing something bad to yourself. (At that level, before proceeding any further, doctors will do bloodwork and use tracer chemicals to ascertain the strength of your BBB — and temporarily switch to giving you other third-line treatments for ADHD, like tricyclics or MAOIs — before going down the path of just giving you "a lot" of stimulants.) ⏤ by *derefr* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### You have to research what receptors and neurons are made out of.     

Sure you can eat things that greatly promotes BDNF/neurogenesis like wild swedish blueberries or Psilocybin, but if your body doesn't have enough building blocks for new dopamine receptors then you won't see as big of an improvement.

From my years of research and understanding, the most important supplements for this (and a lot of other things) seems to be:      
Omega-3 (both DHA & EPA)        
Magnesium glycinate (required to utilize receptors)         
Calcium (extremely important for cells and CNS)          
Iron and Copper (found in very high amounts inside dopamine receptors, although very risky to supplement, only use bisglycinate forms)       
Zinc         
All B-vitamins (preferably methylated)      
Creatine

├─── Well, the dopaminergic model of schizophrenia is currently determined to be *insufficient* in accounting for all of the phenomenology of the disorder.  But there are definitely aberrations in dopaminergic signaling in schizophrenia, both hyperactive and hypoactive.  The problem with using medications that act as silent D2 antagonists to treat positive symptoms is that there is no way to constrain their action to those areas of the CNS where D2-mediated hyperactivity is suspected of causing those symptoms.  Instead, they indiscriminately block any D2 receptors including those in subcortical regions that control motor function as well as the PNS, posing a risk of motor side effects that only increases with long-term treatment.

D2 partial agonism, however, has a modulating effect on signaling (attenuating D2-mediated signaling where hyperactive and amplifying it where hypoactive).  As this not only addresses the aforementioned aberrations in such signaling but also poses a lower risk of motor side effects, this mechanic has become preferred in drug development for schizophrenia and hence the predominant mechanism of third-gen antipsychotics (e.g. aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine).

All that said—and this is to your point—even these newer meds were developed based on an incomplete model.  The current research on aberrations in glutamate signaling appear to be revealing another model which may prove to either complement the dopaminergic model or indicate something upstream of dopaminergic signaling that could overhaul pharmacological treatment altogether. ⏤ by *Phrenologeist* (↑ 10/ ↓ 0)
├──── Going beyond all of the technical discussions, the following fundamental point just makes you wonder.

Recovery from Schizophrenia has taken longer, the relapse into symptoms happens more often and long term outcomes are worse, on average, since the introduction of antipsychotics.

And the disaster of Zyprexa ($1.3 billion, yes billion, in fines), speaks volumes on what's going on in mental health treatements.

We seem more interested in neurons, pills and our pay checks than connection and vulnerability in our communities and family. ⏤ by *Live-Fee5421* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├───── Couldn’t agree more.  I worry that the hyperfocus on pharmacological treatment in most mental health subs (and, I would argue, r/Nootropics and r/StackAdvice as well) reflects a growing cultural disregard of some of the fundamental needs of being human—a sense of belonging, of competency, and of societal contribution.

From my conversations with those diagnosed with schizophrenia as well as those who research or treat the disorder, I’ve come away with the impression that more holistic treatment approaches where therapy-led intrapersonal reconciliation with benign positive symptoms (read: not drugging every single hallucinated voice into oblivion) and treatment emphasizing social connection and support seem to be getting the proactive attention of more and more mental health practitioners.

What’s missing, at least in the United States, is sufficient outreach and access to such treatment once it enters mainstream practice.  We have had the tax base to establish such access for decades and yet many legislative representatives in state and federal government (not to mention a sizable albeit dwindling portion of our electorate) unabashedly oppose any budget allocations to make it happen.

Until that happens, the fruits of U.S.-based research on non-pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia will effectively be largely ideational exports to those parts of the world where such funding exists to implement them for *every* consenting person who suffers the disorder. ⏤ by *Phrenologeist* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)

The Army may give you a clean diet but not an optimised diet. Some people with ADHD (and other indications) would benefit a lot from specific dietary tweaks. Depends on the individuals so hard to comment other than in general. On fresh air, sometimes the dose makes it. I recommend daily breathwork as a panacea that certainly covers ADHD symptoms.

├────── It depends on the pharmacodynamics of the med, specifically the relative magnitude in binding affinity between that for non-dopamine receptors usually targeted in such drugs (e.g. H1, 5-HT2A, alpha-1a) and for dopamine receptors (mainly D2, though some act on other subtypes as well).  The receptors for which a drug has the highest affinity are going to be affected first and foremost.

The first-gen APs’ highest affinities are almost invariably for D2, with affinities for other receptors being weaker, so the smallest therapeutic dose (for psychotic positive symptoms) is just going to exert an effect on those targeted dopamine receptors and not much else.

But, to your point, the second-gen APs are a different breed, with a pharmacodynamical trend of having much higher affinity for H1 relative to that for dopamine receptors.  This group varies quite a bit in terms of this relative magnitude however, with olanzapine having the smallest difference (that is, its affinity for H1 is not much stronger than that for D2) and quetiapine having the largest (its affinity for H1 being two orders of magnitude stronger than that for D2).  Which means quetiapine at low dosages (12.5-25 mg) is going to be acting primarily as an H1 antagonist, with negligible effect at D2.

It’s about the only antipsychotic for which this is true, though.  I *definitely* wouldn’t recommend using this same mini-dosing approach with typical APs like haloperidol or pimozide. ⏤ by *Phrenologeist* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
