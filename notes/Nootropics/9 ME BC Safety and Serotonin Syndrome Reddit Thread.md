# 9-Me-BC

Looking for some anecdotal discussion on 9-Me-BC. 

Dosage? Cycling? 
Outcomes? Good and bad 

I have been on Seroquel and Mirtazapine. I am no longer on these and still feel tired, brain fog and have a low libido (37 year old male). 

Love to see some discussion on if you tried, dosage and outcomes?

## Comments

##### Dosage: 5-15mg/day in the morning (oral)

Cycling: In my experience I haven't needed to, in fact the effects improved and felt more permanent with time (if I abruptly stopped). 

Outcomes: <mark>Very good, acutely works as an MAOI (A/B) that provides medium-strong stimulation throughout the day, long-term it reverses DR downregulation.Overdosing or stacking with other stims is counterproductive at best, neurotoxic at worst. Stack instead with antioxidants (e.g. astaxanthin, PQQ, CoQ-10, NAC) and neurogenics (e.g. NSI-189, DHF, Semax, P21).</mark>

I don't know how long the MAO-A inhibitor effects last so don't mix with your antidepressant medication otherwise there's a real chance of serotonin syndrome

├─ Thank you, super appreciate your feedback. This is exactly what I was looking for.  I still have some minor concerns... but I don’t drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. A short trial surely won’t be world ending. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├─ "Long-term it reverses DR downregulation"

do you mean dopamine? in essence (and I have been thinking about this a little lately), dopaminergic sensization or drug sensitization? apparently it also boosts BDNF/NGF and that, but the substance seems somewhat new and experimental but I have seen a fair few anecdotes.

Got a question: Random thing to ask but, is there any chance of temporary (it would probably be the opposite but I need to check) sexual dysfunction from this? Yeah like for some reason pretty much anything I try that interacts with norepinephrine/serotonin I have noticed tends to cause that. ⏤ by *MDD678* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── In my experience at least, I would say no, it's unlikely you'll experience sexual dysfunction if you take reasonable dosages in the morning with reasonable stacking. It's actually one of the few dopaminergics I've tried that actually delivers in the libido department, and consistently.

The only way I see it damaging your libido when taking it sensibly will be if

a) it's impure and there are other beta-carbolines present that cause dopamine neurotoxicity when metabolised by MAOs. This is why some people are concerned about it causing Parkinson's, although I'm aware of this happening to anyone yet — then again, it could take years to find out. I've been using Hydrapharm 'till now but I plan to switch to [Science.bio](https://Science.bio)'s product just in case.

b) it gives you insomnia. ⏤ by *Humancyclone7* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├─── Weird that you mention insomnia cause I’ve been taking the same product and haven’t noticed any insomnia even though I take it before bed ⏤ by *electro1234567890* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── Wow, how are you able to get to sleep then? Do you take sleep aids with it? A reduced dose? Any reason for taking it in the evening as opposed to morning?

Only way I could do the same is if I were severely exhausted and the 9-Me-BC couldn't mask it any longer. I guess what you're saying is possible though e.g. I get consistently lethargic if I take 1000mg tyrosine, but 500mg energises me nicely, others get sleepy from adderall 😐 ⏤ by *Humancyclone7* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├───── I take a 10 mg dose and I notice a smidge of mood alterations but no insomnia I do have more energy on average when I am taking it but it’s not directly stimulating for me it’s nothing like caffeine for example and the only other supplement I’m taking at the moment is magnesium 250mg twice a day ⏤ by *electro1234567890* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├───── I would like to add to this, I’ve stopped taking the Carboline at night and I have noticed it was likely effecting my sleep cause I feel more rested on average and probably didn’t notice much difference initially cause I have also done copious amounts of caffeine and still managed to go to sleep ⏤ by *electro1234567890* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

Also, doesn't stomach acid break down 9-Me-BC? How do you dose it? If orally, do you use regular capsules or [enteric capsules](https://www.lfatabletpresses.com/articles/benefits-of-enteric-coated-capsules)? ⏤ by *Aetherpor* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──── Yes, they provide CoAs. Predator Nutrition does not, [and they haven't been ethical in the past.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/gm27hb/uk_predator_nutrition_fined_10k_over_their/)

I can't find information on stomach acid affecting 9-Me-BC's potency, but taking it orally is definitely weaker than sublingual — presumably a good amount doesn't reach the brain due to liver metabolism or inhibiting MAOs in the gut.

Sublingual is best, just don't take it often this way or you'll erode your enamel and gumline. ⏤ by *Humancyclone7* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── It might be unrelated/coincidence but since I started taking it 3 days ago I have been a fucking savage in the bed. My libido has been crazy high and this has not happened before with anything.

├─ So you can’t mix with antidepressants? I’m on max dose Prozac ⏤ by *aBeautifulMindz* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── Yes, **don't mix with antidepressants** otherwise the results could be fatal — with that being said I haven't experienced problems taking 500mg Tryptophan in the evening, following a 15mg dose of 9-Me-BC in the morning.

Prozac has a very long half-life — 96hrs to 144hrs — and you need about 4-5 half-lives to clear it out, so you'd need to wait 16 to 30 days (+25 recommended) before you could take 9-Me-BC without serious risk.

Not that I'm encouraging you to do that though, since coming off of high-dose Prozac after extended use will be very unpleasant and you need to talk it through with your physician if that's something you want to pursue.

Edit: You might want to look into [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y_8usEhGvx439m61u79Tpv-xjss9j75HNdrYtb_eCCo/edit) for other options that you can safely take, namely Jiaogulan and Agmatine. ⏤ by *Humancyclone7* (↑ 17/ ↓ 0)

Why? Because it's MAOB-I? ⏤ by *voyager256* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├─ So it could possibly improve my anhedonia? ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├── Yes, it should. 

If it doesn't, there are other factors you might need to address first e.g. bad sleep, choline dominance, nutritional deficiencies.

Or it could be that you have an imbalance in neurotransmitters other than dopamine. ⏤ by *Humancyclone7* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─── definitely bad sleep

do you know if 9-Me-BC fixes dopamine receptors? ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── That's something I'm unsure of and would like to know myself.

It definitely upregulates the production of dopamine through TH and it regenerates and protects dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and hippocampus through the induction of growth factors (CDNF seems to be the real heavy hitter). Presumably these new neurons will have dopamine receptors?

In any case, it must be doing something to prevent the downregulation of receptors otherwise people would be reporting tolerance gain or horrible withdrawals after extended use — I have yet to see any reports like that, and haven't experienced it myself.

An interesting summary of it:

├───── is it okay to take with food...? ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─ IIRC MAO-A inhibition works largely on dopamine receptors while MAO-B inhibition works largely on the Serotonin and Noradrenaline receptors. I am quite open to being wrong about that though.

├─ Is this molecule an irreversible MAOI? I cannot say for sure from the existing papers that showed monoamine oxidase activity but it seems unlikely given that irreversible inhibitors are rare, they have a very different structure, and other beta-carbolines that inhibit monoamine oxidase are not irreversible; the ones in coffee and tobacco can achieve 50-60% inhibition. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139309/

Reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, while they are likely to potentiate, do not have these life-threatening severe interactions with psychostimulants and sympathomimetics that irreversible inhibitors can have.

├── Seems to be reversible (both A/B)

Anecdotally, the MAOI-A effects are strong but MUCH shorter than the other – I have managed to orally activate DMT with 9-Me-BC before, so I'm sure it could also cause serotonin syndrome under the right conditions, the question is how long it inhibits MAO-A. ⏤ by *Humancyclone7* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─ Sorry I'm late to the party, can I just confirm that by DR you mean dopamine receptor? ⏤ by *NotNutmegAgainLmao* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── Yes. I assume it causes DR upregulation via induction of growth factors, e.g. BDNF upregulates D1 and D3 receptors.

##### I just started a 10 mg a day regimen. It does tend to make you more clear headed and level headed throughout the day. I don't think that I'm far enough in to notice any real effects yet. But I'm starting to feel like part of me is coming back that has been gone for a long time.

I abused stimulants and opiates for years,  meth and heroin mostly but I would take whatever I could get my hands on sometimes. Been clean and sober for 3 years now but been struggling with anhedonia the whole time, which sometimes makes sobriety difficult. 

From what I've researched about this, I know it's possible I could be doing more harm than good with the potential for neurotoxic metabolites. But the chance to be able to feel again outweighs the risk for me. ⏤ by *Muad-Dib* (↑ 10/ ↓ 0)

├─ this \^

I have been royally screwed neurologically for like 3 years now, and I started taking adderall again (actually have ADHD) ... And I believe that made everything worse. I have been very much not okay since january. I'll spare you the details.

All of these nootropics u hear about like alpha-gpc, uridine, ashwagandha, modafinil... either make me MORE foggy and miserable, or just plain don't work.

Bromantane barely even helped, tho it did seem to help my tremor.

The 4 things I have found to help are 1. 9-me-BC 2. Green coffee extract 3. mucuna puriens, and 4. Lions mane in addition to a cocktail of other mushrooms like chaga, reishi, etc.

9-me-BC has seriously helped so many things. I am actually clear headed, my ears don't feel like they are going to explode, the vertigo is gone, and the facial numbness/general neuropathy is significantly better.

I am kind of surprised this could be neurotoxic, because I legit have to get an MRI and there is clearly some damage, or something causing my insane issues. So, if it was neurotoxic, it would make my already damaged head worse... I legit don't have much room to get worse short of going deaf and being paralyzed. 

Does anyone know specifically what areas of the brain this helps? It significantly helps my vestibular issues, plus the facial numbness and other neuropathic scary symptoms, in addition to brain fog relief.

I know the vestibular nerve is near the facial nerve and if it has any sort of neuro protective factor, is it possible it can treat/help this area? IMHO it can and does. ⏤ by *theremystics* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)

##### Sorry, I'm not answering the question exactly, but I want to offer you some advice. Those drugs are hardcore in terms of the nerve damage they can cause as you take them and especially in withdrawal. If you're off them, first of all congratulations for doing that because it's not easy for everybody. Second, it takes time to recover from that and the best thing you can do is go natural for a while. Stop feeding it too many substances that aren't healthy food. 

I know what I am talking about, I am u/pharmamess ;-). I've been on that long road to recovery, I'm almost there. I talk to people in my recovery group who have been to similar depths of despair, at various stages of recovery. There are layers of illness. You can't get better overnight because all your circadian rhythms are out of whack, your nervous system is dysregulated, many have dysbiosis... all this stuff makes you ill in a way that can't be tackled in a single move. There's no miracle cure for it and you're more likely to do yourself further injury to look for one. Eat clean (no processed food is the main thing) and every day do one of either a 30+ minute brisk walk or practice deep breathing exercises for 20 mins and you'll make good improvements and could be back to something like normal in a matter of months. Those (presumable) lifestyle adaptations alone will make a massive difference. Meditation, yoga, cutting down on screen time are some bonus selections that will put the icing on the cake. 

Whether you know it or not, you need to heal. These suggestions are foundational to a good approach. More simply, be good to yourself and give it time. These drugs make you feel permanently broken but it's only true if you believe it. Body and mind have an amazing capacity to heal. Please don't get sucked into anything drastic. Some supplements may help marginally but they aren't going to make more of a difference than good self care. Good luck. ⏤ by *pharmamess* (↑ 12/ ↓ 0)
├─ Not sure how you got the impression that mirtazapine causes nerve damage but I definitely second your suggestion of establishing a foundation of good self-care habits.  Seems to be overlooked quite often on subs discussing clinical use of supplements and medications. ⏤ by *Phrenologeist* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├── Too often on this sub people only consider the acute effects of drugs. Try taking mirtazapine every day for a few years and then try to come off it and see what happens. I'll give you that it's a cleaner drug compared with many drugs of comparable stature but it's not innocuous. But I'm expecting the Seroquel to cause most havoc and that's mainly what I was referring to. 

It's very common for people to recover over the course of months after withdrawing from long term use of these drugs. That's a fact but it's not well known so people end up doing desperate things to try and fix themselves and quite often end up making the problem worse. Sometimes by far the best course is to give things a rest and that's the point I was making in a probably too verbose manner. ⏤ by *pharmamess* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├─ I do appreciate your response and do agree. Hanging up a few prescribed medications for another Nootropic is not truly the key to the problem.  

I spent 36 years not needing any medication to sleep or function. I made a choice in my life and my sleep was the first thing that suffered. Doctor gave me Seroquel for sleep... and that started the downward spiral that lead me to Wellbutrin, Zopiclone and Mirtazapine.  

I should have not resorted to my doctor for sleep help and instead worked on me. 

I do eat healthy, exercise daily and live a mostly healthy lifestyle. 

I really only ventured down to 9MBC to see if I could give myself a little helping hand. I do agree I need more time to heal and 9MBC or any chemical is not the key. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
├── Thanks for that. I have come in for a lot of flack which I think is due to a misreading of my intention. I noticed somebody who seemed to have been damaged by psych meds and it wasn't clear to me how much you knew about that. I probably strayed from my main point which is that it can take a lot of time to recover. Not everybody knows that it can take so long to recover and that can lead to desperate/drastic interventions that derail your health further. It's how ~~the psych med business~~ psychiatry works. Walk into a doctor's office and tell them you're 6 months clear of pharmaceuticals and they will tell you that whatever problem you have can't possibly be because of damage from pharmaceuticals. That's how they are trained and they believe what they say... but it's such a load of bull. I'm glad you're on the right path. It can take months but you'll get back to your old self if you don't do anything drastic. I hope that you make tangible progress soon and if the odd supplement helps, great!

To anybody else, sorry if you didn't like my post and you think I went overboard with the self-care and you don't like the "woo". I did not assume anything about OP except that he appears to be damaged by psych meds, which it turns out I was correct about. If you were as familiar with this world as I am, you'd understand why I showed concern even though I didn't have the full facts. Sometimes it's worth taking a chance when the cost of being wrong is insignificant compared with the upside of helping somebody to better understand the problem they have.

├── You should examine the scientific literature in greater detail. I used terminology that anybody can understand. I had a wider point to make that I wanted to come through more than I desired to dive into the technicalities. It's not a vague ailment. He's been on powerful psychotropic drugs and my assumption that he's damaged by them is sensible. So I believe that you're wrong to dismiss my framing this as about healing and recovery. "Dysregulation of the nervous system" is a mild way to put it. How about shrinking parts of the brain in the case of Seroquel? That stuff is poison. 

You sound like someone who believes too much in the medical community to be truly healthy. I'm sure you could take me apart for saying that, I don't care.

├─── Mirtazapine and quetiapine have some pharmacodynamical overlap (strong H1 antagonism, moderate 5-HT2A antagonism) but you and I would probably agree that quetiapine’s strong M3 antagonism and modest D2 antagonism sets it apart from mirtazapine, and that these particular affinities make it a potentially deleterious medication if taken at high dosage (300 mg and above) long-term.

But the dosage matters.  At 25-50 mg, these latter affinities of quetiapine pose very low risk of adverse long-term effects.  Its D2 antagonism at that dosage range is almost clinically insignificant, especially given that quetiapine is far more easily displaced by dopamine itself compared to older antipsychotics.

I still very much appreciate your top-level comment on self-care.  There’s a lot of good advice there!  I just feel it’s worth clarifying that the potential adverse effects of quetiapine on metabolism and motor functioning are dependent on dosage and length of use. ⏤ by *Phrenologeist* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)

You don't like that I didn't dive as deep into the science as you'd like. I don't like that you're being deliberately provocative in a way that is designed to cause upset and offense. We all have different priorities. ⏤ by *pharmamess* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├── I don't really disagree with anything you said apart from that you seem to be implying that I said something more than I actually did. I mean, I used the word "cure" just once and what I said is there are "no miracle cures". 

Respectfully, I think I know a lot more about psych med recovery groups than you do. You're right that re-emergence of symptoms from before the drugs is a factor. Absolutely, these people are vulnerable in that way. However, to think that it's not possible to separate this out is frankly absurd. The main way that I know that it takes months/years to heal from psych med damage and that psych med damage is the cause a lot of the time is from tracking people in the community over a significant period of time. Some of these people start off in quite extreme states of disrepair and you would assume they can't heal naturally without drugs. Some of them have to take a pragmatic view but some stick it out and you see them slowly recover functioning. This is the only way to understand the long term effects of psych meds. How could you possibly replicate this in experiments? It would be unethical and anyway, there's no money in getting people off pharmaceuticals.

Psych meds are way overprescribed for situation conditions, as happened with me. I was too young to realise that a corporate job was not for me and the anxiety I was having was because I am not a dick and I couldn't stand to carry out my duties, teaming up with our extensive team of lawyers to trample all over small businesses. I'm simplifying but you get the idea. Your assumption that everybody who finds themselves on meds has something more wrong with them than the average person is misguided. ⏤ by *pharmamess* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### I might try this. When I was misdiagnosed with bipolar (I have PTSD and DID actually, no signs of mania or psychosis whatsoever), I was on abilify and then a methhead poisoned me in my weed with some kind of mystery dopaminergic stimulant that I think was an OD of meth. It gave me permanent restless legs syndrome. Thanks for posting. ⏤ by *StarRoadExits* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

##### I hate to say this but every time a new compound becomes popular on this sub and I try it after people talk about it’s ability to fix their years long broken brain or make them feel amazing or increase their verbal fluidity or make them able to focus to level equal to adderall it is a huge let down. There are a few things that actually had some effects for me but they were minimal. Most recently one that didn’t do shit for me was polygala. I don’t believe what people say anecdotally anymore. I have wasted money and time on a bunch of shit that should have changed my life based on people’s experience reports. None of this stuff is probably going to do much including 9 me bc. It sucks because I would really like to find things that make a huge difference for me. The few things that seem to work have some pretty big drawbacks. Cyclazodone comes to mind. It really works as a functional stimulant but may cause liver failure just like it’s closely related cousin pemoline. I have selegiline in the mail from adc so I am hoping that it makes a big difference for me but I mostly now just assume that everything on here is way overblown. ⏤ by *ianonuanon* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─ Same here. I have a closet full of disappointments: Noopept, Phenylpiracetam, Aniracetam, L-Theanine, Agmatine, Sulbutiamine, Cordyceps, Maca...

The only ones that did kind of work to some extent are Uridine Monophosphate (as part of Happy Stack) and maybe Bromantane (not enough to discard placebos).

Besides, Phenibut and Modafinil but I don't consider them nootropics. ⏤ by *gravwave* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├── What exactly did you experience with the uridine? How did you take it? ⏤ by *ianonuanon* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── I felt more energetic, higher mood to some extent. I was intending to combat astenia. I felt it in the beginning but after 2 weeks it was less perceptible. The problem is that I can’t know if at that moment I was just at a slightly better cycle and attributed it to the stack. It was not super impactful, but I think it did something and recommend you to give it a try.

I took it as part of a famous stack combination called mr happy stack, in which you include omega 3, vit b complex, green tea extract and choline? The synergy between these is supposed to amplify uridine. If you google “mr happy stack” or search for it in reddit you’ll find a lot of info. ⏤ by *gravwave* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├─ I have had my T checked... it is normal low. I have been making great strides on diet, compound exercise etc.  Include Vit D, k2, zinc and copper.

├── Take magnesium as well before bed and in the morning 1000mg total. Also what’s ur T level if you don’t mind me asking ⏤ by *BloodyWashCloth* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── If I remember correct last checked 430ng/dL. My doctor was not too concerned. He sent me to a specialized doctor at my request. 

That doctor told me, he knows men who are well below 300 ng/dl that have an over active libido and others who can be at 1000 that don’t.  

He said, T does impact but it is not the key to an active libido.  

I was on Wellbutrin and at the start first 3-4 months my libido was non-stop... after months on Seroquel which I am no longer on... it just never came back.  

My doctor does not support me going over and over for blood work... so either I push to go more often or I find another doctor.  

I do take three pills of MagEnhance for sleep [link](https://thereviewindex.com/us/p/MagEnhance_Best_Magnesium_Supplement_Magnesium_L_Threonate_Complex_with_Magnesium_Glycinate_and_Taur/AZ-US_B073WZ9SM3) but maybe I am just taking the wrong type of magnesium.

##### I ordered some the other day. Tried to cancel the order after I read more . Sounds good at 1st but once you dig into It more there is too many risks and you can't really test the purity of it. Let you know when I get it , still not sure if I plan on using it . ⏤ by *Diogenes81* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├── Well there's the the possibility it could alter dna in the sunlight , which I was kind of ok with . The other one which I became more aware of after the purchase,  being it neuro toxic it's a beta Carboline I think it's called and their neurotoxic . It says this one isn't it s neuroprotective. But I've read that In vivo it can be turned back into a neurotoxin , also if I don't know the purity who's to say it's completely free of other beta Carbolines. Just wasn't a well thought out purchase on my part. ⏤ by *Diogenes81* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
