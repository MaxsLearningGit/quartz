# 9-ME-BC Harm Reduction

I ordered some 9-ME-BC from [science.bio](https://science.bio) and then, at some point after it arrived, I read this post about 9-ME-BC neurotoxicity: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/g2mkz4/9mebc\_endogenous\_conversion\_to\_neurotoxic\_29mebc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/g2mkz4/9mebc_endogenous_conversion_to_neurotoxic_29mebc/)

I've done some searches in to harm reduction but haven't found anything. I'd hate to waste the compound. Are there any ways to mitigate harm done by 9-ME-BC other than avoiding its use completely?

##### I have a very hard time buying that these experiments on guinea pigs are A to A with humans. There could be enzyme disparities between species or other discrepancies that are not being modeled precisely. There is really no record of anyone ever questioning if 9 was a neurotoxin before this post you linked. I have to question.. if 9 actually has the potential to be a neurotoxin, then how did it get used by hundreds to thousands of people... never get detected or brought up as a neurotoxin, cause no noticeable damage worth noting, convince a ton of people it was healing their dopamine systems...etc  and make the majority of the experimenters think "Wow, its so crazy this awesome molecule exists!"

Can it possibly be a neurotoxin, maybe.  Just doesn't seem like it.. at all.. even a lil... beyond this article on guinea pigs. ⏤ by *Volcanyx* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─ No one ever questioned it? Every other known chemical like it is a neurotoxin, no? Even if consensus was that it wasn't neurotoxic, this certainly isn't the first musing that I might be. ⏤ by *Slapbox* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── Beyond this paper thats been circulated lately, everytime I have seen literature about 9mbc and neurotoxins its pretty plainly stated that it differs dramatically from other beta carbolines in the fact that it doesnt seem to be a neurotoxin, it is restorative to the areas that would be damaged by other bc molecules, regenerates the dopamine system, etc. More pointedly, I was discussing user reports.. of the many out there I dont think I have ever seen a self experimenter come running to reddit wondering what happened to their brain over night after doing 10, 20, 50mg of 9mbc the night before. Which I find really strange considering a few cans of beer can make people wonder what the fuck wrong they did the day before... yet 500 mgs into a 9mbc container no one is wondering whats fucking up their brains? It isnt just the lack of evidence that throws these claims off.. no one even considered that something might be wrong after taking 9mbc. Wouldnt at least a few people have gottena  tiny blip on the radar? Wouldnt at least a single person have come forward and said "Im not sure... but it seems something is wrong after doing that 9.... I just havent felt normal" 

I just dont believe 9mbc is a neurotoxin based off the amount of people that have done it and reported back to the web the results. Anyone that is too scared to finish off their last bits of it please feel free to message me on how we can dispose of it! ⏤ by *Volcanyx* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

I can tell you many motivation and longevity chemicals are being systemically suppressed. This is probably one of them.

Chemical in Acorus Calamus is another one. Beta Aserone - because it resets your conditioned fight responses, making you less tolerant of an unenriched environment and bad authority. SSRIs do the opposite. ⏤ by *Darkhorseman81* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### In the studies that I have read it is quite the opposite, it is neuro-protective  from carbolines that are neuro-toxic.  I have never seen a citation for 9 being neuro-toxic.  I have seen arm-chair scientists hypothesize on the matter, so until someone can produce a citation, as far as I am concerned it is an urban legend.    [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06725.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06725.x)AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE, IT WOULD BE MENTIONED IN THIS 2020 STUDY [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32285253/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32285253/)   I apologize for the caps, but read the 2020 study.  Here is a quote  

 "Remarkably, 9-me-BC stimulated the gene expression of several important neurotrophic factors for dopaminergic neurons like Artn, Bdnf, Egln1, Tgfb2 and Ncam1. These factors are well known to stimulate neurite outgrowth and to show neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties to dopaminergic neurons against various toxins. Further, we show that effect of 9-me-BC is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Additionally, 9-me-BC showed inhibitory properties to monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity with an IC50 value of 1 µM for MAO-A and of 15.5 µM for MAO-B. The inhibition of MAO by 9-me-BC might contribute to the observed increased dopamine content and anti-apoptotic properties in cell culture after 9-me-BC treatment in recent studies. Thus, 9-me-BC have a plethora of beneficial effects on dopaminergic neurons warranting its exploration as a new multimodal anti-parkinsonian medication."  

The studies indicate the exact opposite and in fact one of the best things you can do for your brain if your dopergenic system is trashed from ADHD drugs or stimulant abuse. ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
├─ [Here is a study demonstrating neurotoxicity from 9-methyl-norharman (9-me-bc)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9453568/). 9-me-bc, when administered to mice, metabolized to 2,9-dimethyl-beta-carboline, with a corresponding reduction in brain dopamine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons.

The dose used in this study is higher than others, so it is possible that 9-me-bc is beneficial in lower doses. It is noteworthy that the only studies that have shown benefits from 9-me-bc were done with rats, which have [less active metabolism to 2,9-dimethyl-beta-carboline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/000689939290576U) (compared to guinea pigs) and are also significantly more resistant to neurotoxins such as MPP+ due to having less active MOA-B.

I bought some 9-me-bc with the intention of using it to reduce amphetamine tolerance. Now I am probably not going to take it unless more in vivo research is published with animals other than rats. ⏤ by *99spider* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── Thank you!  I've been using if for about a week.  I had to 1/4 my ADHD meds though because I was severely overstimulated.  There are 8 of us running 30mg per day at the time being.  Several people have commented to me how sharp and just spot-on that I have been with everything.  I feel like my brain is super high definition, at least the first week.  With 8 of us, I will be able to share more experiences. ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Just curious, what is your route of administration? I have heard some say sublingual is far more effective but have also heard that it tastes terrible and is even mildly corrosive (one anecdote somewhere of tooth decay). ⏤ by *99spider* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── Sublingual, you will be looking for a new tongue.  Ouch.  Nasty stuff.  We've been doing enteric coated capsules to get it past stomach acid, subq injection, rectal, but after tasting it, we have not been able to talk anyone into trying nasal - but honestly could not let anyone try that.  It is soluble in DMSO.  Nootropic effects and stimulant effects are unanimous.  I do not believe that anyone has done sublingual with real 9-Me-BC, it is literally impossible.  Enteric capsules seem to be the best bet for regular use. ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── I can say for certain that stimulant users immediately, day one, required much less stimulant with concurrent use (me +3).  As a group we started this trial less than a week ago, so I do not know whether tolerance will be reduced with a cessation of 9-Me-BC.  But the nootropic effects have been immediate and in some cases profound. ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── You likely know this as you seem to have read a lot into 9-Me-BC, but the immediate effect on tolerance is likely a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition rather than dopaminergic neurogeneration. 

I really want 9-Me-BC to be beneficial. It very well might be beneficial at some small dosage level. Tobacco and coffee have been shown to be protective against Parkinson's despite the fact that both contain small amounts of beta-carboline (which could also metabolize to neurotoxic 2,9-dime-bc), although the amount is far below the doses of 9-me-bc people are using. ⏤ by *99spider* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── Thanks, I really appreciate this info.  It is a team effort.  Yes, I agree that neuro-regeneration will take months.  Years of damage is not going to happen in weeks or a month.  That is where folks go wrong with peptides or compounds that promote neurogenesis.  But  there is definitely a dopamine component because you can skip adhd doses, and the stimulation is similar, especially at 30mg twice a day.  If anyone wants to join the experiment, we have  a lot. ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── Please cite that it could metabolize into a carboline neurotoxin, because the studies that I have read says it profoundly protects against the neurotoxic effects of other carbolines. ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├───── [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9453568/) shows 2,9-dimethyl-beta-carboline being formed in mice that were administered 9-methyl-beta-carboline (notated as 9-methyl-norharman in the study). 2-Me-BC and BC were also tested. All beta carbolines resulted in 2,9-dime-bc formation. All mice administered any of the BCs suffered dopaminergic neuron loss, but the most damage was caused by 9-Me-BC administration, with the 9-Me-BC group developing the highest levels of 2,9-dime-BC. It is possible that doses over a certain threshold become neurotoxic with 9-Me-BC, or that its effects strongly depend on the specific enzyme activity of the species it is administered to. ⏤ by *99spider* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├────── but  9-mono-N'-methylnorharman (9-MeNH) is a totally different chemical ⏤ by *BuhidoWarrior* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─────── Shit you're right, I messed up. 9-methyl-norharman is listed as a name for 9-me-bc on its wikipedia page, but searching 9-mono-N'-methyl-norharman shows a chemical with a methyl in what I believed was notated as the 2 position of the BC. The numbering indicating positions on the harmane structure seems inconsistent with different literature. ⏤ by *99spider* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

├── I’m 27, I’ve been on Adderall, prescribed- for 4 years now daily. Before than I started using it when I was 21 along with a plethora of hard drugs here and there back in the partying stages of my life. Hard stuff like MDMA frequently. It’s not so much that I feel like my dopamine system is completely shot, since I have a very healthy lifestyle now and all those days of experimentation with drugs is over 5 years behind me it’s more so that I was expecting it (or both including NSI) to aide in my depression and motivational issues which I long suspected was tied to my youth days.

├──── My max dose for 9-me-BC was probably 50mg. I could never do more than 3 days in a row since I was taking Adderall concurrently- the residual MAOI effects made my skin crawl. Very strange. NSI kept giving me brain fog on top of that. My blood pressure and heart rate was moderately high but not super uncomfortable. I also watched what I ate (Due to the cheese/Dairy, MAOI inhibitor complication) but never felt that. Initially I started at 5mg. That’s where I recommend anyone to start. And make sure your MG scale is very accurate. Mine was hard to read anything under 15mg. Kind of screws me anytime I try and weigh out Memantine. ⏤ by *StolenSpirit* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
