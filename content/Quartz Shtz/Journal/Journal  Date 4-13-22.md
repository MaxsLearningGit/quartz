## My Thoughts Currently
Weird, Lethargic. Quite high. I am worried about possible Serotonin Syndrome effects if I mix [[9-me-bc]] 
$Reactions$


### Action 
_To do_: 
1. Try and aim for atleast 10 minutes of exercise a day… But jesus, why do I never feel like doing it anymore? It’s so hard and feels like such drudgery… 
2. Take a Multi-vitamin 
3. Related to the third possible cause, referencing if it’s caused by personality problems; **I will need to <u>reflect</u>.** What do *I feel*? 
4. But what I’m currently trying is repairing my dopamine receptors. I am optimistic that I will feel the energy and motivation I once had 6-7 years ago… in high school 

*For this*, I have compiled a stack of Nootropics.. 
My current stack:
1. Good ol’ [[Inositol]]
2. [[Sulbutiamine]] 
3. [[Cordyceps]] 
4. And, when it arrives, [[9-me-bc]]
