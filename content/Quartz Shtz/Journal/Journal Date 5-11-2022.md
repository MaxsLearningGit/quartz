It’s been about 3 hours that I have been 24… as soon as it hit 12:00, it felt underwhelming, sort of… I felt— sad. 

I need to get a move-on in life… I’m not getting anywhere, and I know I’m just letting everyone down..

But I suppose that’s enough of me being self-critical.. I should be happy — despite time passing, I still have made it, and have made it through alot… I should be happy I’m 24… 

I even made those weird, over-sentimental videos where I obsess over the time, right before it hits midnight and such (or otherwise “Hey guys look, it’s 11 pm and it’s almost my birthday” type videos)

###  Oh well, Happy Birthday to myself.. 🎊🎂🥳✨

-3:50 AM: Watching “# The Storm From The East: Vol 1 - Birth of An Empire”
soon to go to bed.

-4:00 AM: Time to lay down / bed time
