Time: 6:56 PM 
Drew’s about to leave, I just lit my birthday joint that was included in the gift basket by my old man… Wanting someone to smoke with me, but Drew has to go to work, and ~~idk where Matthew is at this moment~~  (he’s cutting grass). Stand by 😆

Time: 8:14 PM 
High, listening to music… a little underwhelmed with my productivity today, but I still took Vyvanse and have many hours left in the day… 
I sadly didn’t get to spend today as the “*actual*” celebration day… But tomorrow she’s off, so I need to get in bed early tonight.
