[since "switching" between image board mode/mind movie mode can cause something of an overlap or feedback issues due to alternating between your mind's eye and what your physical eye is seeing (switching between a visual image and the book you're reading, for instance). This is perhaps why it is a good idea to focus on forming the mental imagery on the physical page itself... For instance, I'm going to use the word-lasso mode instead of Saccades.. Instead of focusing on three saccades, I run a finger across (or don't), then I try and stretch my reading, so it can absorb varying amount of word groups.. some start small, then I imagine the underline goes to the next word group--the underline either growing or picking up more words as the line goes by... - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=since+%22switching%22+between+image+board+mode%2Fmind+movie+mode+can+cause+something+of+an+overlap+or+feedback+issues+due+to+alternating+between+your+mind%27s+eye+and+what+your+physical+eye+is+seeing+%28switching+between+a+visual+image+and+the+book+you%27re+reading%2C+for+instance%29.+This+is+perhaps+why+it+is+a+good+idea+to+focus+on+forming+the+mental+imagery+on+the+physical+page+itself...+For+instance%2C+I%27m+going+to+use+the+word-lasso+mode+instead+of+Saccades..+Instead+of+focusing+on+three+saccades%2C+I+run+a+finger+across+%28or+don%27t%29%2C+then+I+try+and+stretch+my+reading%2C+so+it+can+absorb+varying+amount+of+word+groups..++some+start+small%2C+then+I+imagine+the+underline+goes+to+the+next+word+group--the+underline+either+growing+or+picking+up+more+words+as+the+line+goes+by...+&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=AOaemvK3OanZFc8gpJ03PcNCrVdLksxsig%3A1641001979896&ei=-7PPYYmwNvSTwbkPxqS88AQ&ved=0ahUKEwjJmdnguI_1AhX0STABHUYSD04Q4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=since+%22switching%22+between+image+board+mode%2Fmind+movie+mode+can+cause+something+of+an+overlap+or+feedback+issues+due+to+alternating+between+your+mind%27s+eye+and+what+your+physical+eye+is+seeing+%28switching+between+a+visual+image+and+the+book+you%27re+reading%2C+for+instance%29.+This+is+perhaps+why+it+is+a+good+idea+to+focus+on+forming+the+mental+imagery+on+the+physical+page+itself...+For+instance%2C+I%27m+going+to+use+the+word-lasso+mode+instead+of+Saccades..+Instead+of+focusing+on+three+saccades%2C+I+run+a+finger+across+%28or+don%27t%29%2C+then+I+try+and+stretch+my+reading%2C+so+it+can+absorb+varying+amount+of+word+groups..++some+start+small%2C+then+I+imagine+the+underline+goes+to+the+next+word+group--the+underline+either+growing+or+picking+up+more+words+as+the+line+goes+by...+&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAM6BAgAEEdKBQg6EgExSgUIPBIBMUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFCJD1iInRZg-voWaAFwA3gWgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz)
