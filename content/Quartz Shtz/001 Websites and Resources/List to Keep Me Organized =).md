5. [Awesome Open Source](https://awesomeopensource.com/) - Great depot for all kinds of things-- programming, reading lists, how-to's, etc. There's even an [Obsidian section](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/obsidian) which includes [Awesome Obsidian](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/kmaasrud/awesome-obsidian) , a great resource for Obsidian including themes, presets, guides, etc.
6. [[Learn Awesome]] (https://learnawesome.org/)- Very similar to Awesome Open Source, and may have overlap. It has still introduced me to the next link, which is a great learning guide!
