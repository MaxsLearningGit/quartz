When you're on the verge of dying, you don't give a ranch's ass about "anything". You know the phrase, "life flashing before your eyes"? Well, I'd say it's more accurate to say that you reflect upon everything, very quickly. Within an elongated minute, you realize everything that is important and everything that is not. _There is a clear list of things that matter, and a clear list of things that does not matter._
>
When I say "it does not matter", I mean every word of it. Not in a sense that some non-important things are more important than other non-important things-- no. There will be a list of things that matter and a list of things that **do not matter, 100%**. My beloved shoe collection didn't mean shit to me. My complicated project that I was stressing over didn't mean shit to me. My sports team that I loved following didn't mean shit to me. My lingering acquantances didn't mean shit to me.
>
My friends mattered. My family mattered.
>
What my parents accomplished didn't matter. What my sister didn't accomplish didn't matter. Nothing they have done in their professional lives mattered to me in that stretched minute. What mattered to me was my family and friends being there for me throughout my life. That's it.
>
So to get to my point: Mr. Rockhold most likely didn't give a shit about the belt. He didn't feel sad for Luke losing his belt because it didn't really matter. Mr. Rockhold rejoiced for having Luke in his life. That was enough for Mr. Rockhold.

## UNRELATED, but remember you can INSERT a small window of a note INTO THIS NOTE, by simply linking a Note, and then adding an exclamation before the brackets!

For example:

![[Learning to Learn (Efficient Learning) -Zero to Mastery]]

…. The entire thing! This is an entire course’s worth of notes in one small window INSIDE A NOTE. CRAZY! 

# ALSO  CHECK THIS OUT
[test](wow) 
USE BRACKET TO MAKE A TERM LINK TO SOMETHING [wow] , FOLLOWED BY A TERM IN PARANTHESES (yo)

[wow](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=random%20quote%20i%20found%20from%20reddit%20thats%20good%20NEAR%20DEATH%20EXPERIENCE)

ACTUALLY- do the method above, but when linking to notes (especially if they have a long title), then you must go to THAT NOTE, click on three dots in top right, then go to “copy Obsidian URL”… You then put this in the parentheses, and your link is done!
