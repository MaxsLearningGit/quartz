3.  Hyper FocusðŸ”Ž
	- With Focus, you put all of your attention on one thing
	- THUS, we are able to get into the **depths of things**
		- When we get into the **depths of things** is when we make true progress.                   
            --This is because *superficial learning* isn't efficient. In order to truly acquire knowledge on a subject, we must focus to understand the deeper information to actually become useful.
