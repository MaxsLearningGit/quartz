# Where do you buy 9-Me-Bc from?

I bought from reach genius once which made me feel like I had been poisoned and that my brain was falling apart, and I don't want to risk that again with some random vendor. Know any good ones?

##### I am currently taking the liquid 9MeBC from science bio… day 9 of 30

Seems extremely high quality and so far so good. ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─ How do you take it? I'm curious do you just drop it right on the tongue ⏤ by *Damiana7675* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── Yes I put it under my tongue. I leave it 15 mins, I try for 20 mins and swallow. 

It has a numbing effect. So your mouth will produce a lot of saliva. By the time your 15-20 minutes is up… the 9MeBC will be diluted. 

It has changed my taste for sure. Sweet no longer taste sweet. I also was not a fan of spicy foods but was able to eat spicy take away with no issues. 

I made some canned mushroom soup today and it had no taste. I had to add hot sauce to make it even register taste. Toothpaste also does not have much taste. 

At the moment the lack of taste stays all day and night. 

My plan is 30 day till I end my trial. Currently on 15mg when I wake up. ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Meybe dont keep It in ur mouth for so long ? If It fucks ut taste so u dont fuck ur taste pernament i have the same i just drink It dirrectly instead , do u fink It could make ur taste pernament worse ⏤ by *Dizzy_Literature_419* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── So after weeks of research apparently the absorption is weak orally. So if you swallow a pill or swallow the fluid quickly. 

I read best absorption is 20-30 sublingually. Hence why I am keeping it under my tongue for so long. 

Since 9MeBC is a research chemical, I myself have been doing heavy research and want to give it the best go around. Hoping the taste loss is temporary. ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├──── Haha I actually enjoy the taste ⏤ by *lmikeselljr* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Have you still lost your sense of taste? The same thing happened to me today with my first dose. I’m nervous that this will be permanent. Do you know if this issue goes away once discontinuing use? ⏤ by *lmikeselljr* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──── I am still taking it, day 19 of 30. Yea my taste is still diminished… not sure the long term but I am enjoying it. Sweet things don’t taste sweet. So I eat less of them. ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├───── That was my initial response too. I had a chocolate covered pretzel and was like... that tasted like a regular pretzel. What was your schedule like for the 30 days if you don’t mind me asking? ⏤ by *lmikeselljr* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├────── I am taking liquid 

Day 1 - 5mg. I was kind of a chicken

Day 2-7 - 10mg

Day 8-14 - 15mg

Day 15-21 - 20mg

And planned last week 30mg ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─────── I got attacked by saliva on 5mg... I can’t imagine what 10-30mg would do... lol. It’s better to be a chicken when you’re being a Guinea Pig with RCs lol. I actually noticed a profound effect at 5mg, so I might stick with it for a while. ⏤ by *lmikeselljr* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─ And what kind of effects do you get from it ⏤ by *Damiana7675* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── Honestly at this point, not much. Since this is a research chemical my mind got ahead of me and day 1… I tried only 5mg, next 4 days was 10mg and now since Saturday I am on 15mg. 

The first night I did have an increase to libido but likely was a placebo kinda thing. Libido still as it was before now. 

I have noticed maybe a little more focus and also a little calming, but very minor at best. 

I have noticed a small disruption in sleep… my sleep has decreased by 60 mins per night. I also wear a watch tracker and my REM and Deep sleep have deceased. ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Lack of taste would suck, def not covid? ⏤ by *ViperAMD* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── I work from home, my only trips outside is once a week to a food store. So covid is extremely unlikely… also zero other symptoms. 

Also the liquid is extremely numbing…
I try my best to only get it under my tongue. If it makes any contact with your lips, it numbs it. 
 
If you tried the liquid, you would understand how “spicy” it tastes and numbs. ⏤ by *anecdotal_guy* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### I’ve been taking the Reach Genius 9-me-bc for a few days and my experience is completely different from yours. Are you taking anything else with it? ⏤ by *akflo* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─ Hi Akflo, how was your experience? Thanks ⏤ by *Birdy1979* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── I am on day 7. I feel overall better - calmer, more focused, more motivated, and energized. I like the effects so far, but I was hoping for more. I’m crossing my fingers additional 2 weeks will bring those desired effects. ⏤ by *akflo* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
├─── Good to hear. What dose you taking? I’m on 15 mg, once or twice a day. 5 days on, 2 days off . 2 months. The effects I had are similar, but definitely level off. ⏤ by *Birdy1979* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── 15mg once a day once I get up. Also, I forgot to add it suppresses appetite very well for me. ⏤ by *akflo* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Hydropharm - 60,   15 mg capsules.  Main reason is that dosing such minuscule amounts (10 -15 mg range)  with pure powder , as sold by Reach Genius and Science.bio are incredibly difficult to measure . Even with accurate scales.  You could end up taking more or less , quite easily, and also just a hassle, each time. ⏤ by *Birdy1979* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─ So instead you buy from a company that refuses to prove that their products are what they say they are. ⏤ by *Affectionate_Back_35* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Both [reachgenius.se](https://reachgenius.se) and [science.bio](https://science.bio) \- both seem good quality and legitimate. Both have COA's available/upon request. ⏤ by *p00pp00pp00p* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─ AFAIK reach genius has only pseudo COA provided by Chinese manufacturers they buy from. Science.bio actually does third party testing on product they receive (also mostly from China) ⏤ by *voyager256* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── That's a good point. I'll take pseudo COA over nothing, but it's not as good as science-bio's ~~own~~ third-party COA's. ⏤ by *p00pp00pp00p* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### Random vendor? Reach genious is very reputable and from a Nordic country with strict rules around this as well. I bought my 9-be-bc from here and i have absolutely no problems with it. Have seen great benefits on day 15 now. ⏤ by *babbisen* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─ Then I must have gotten a bad batch or something because the stuff I got made me feel like absolute SHIT ⏤ by *Damiana7675* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── How long did u use it for? i felt like shit the first 3-4 days. Mild anxiety, fast heartrate and my fine motor skills were gone as well. ⏤ by *babbisen* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Perhaps rumours that 9-mbc can be transformed into  neurotoxin are true. ⏤ by *labratdream* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──── Nah, no evidence for that, and i have yet to see anyone using it 15-20 days reporting long term negative effects, not a singel one and i have done a lot of research on this one. If it was indeed true, somebody definently would have noticed it. ⏤ by *babbisen* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─── I only took it for 2 days and then stopped because I was afraid I was doing damage to my brain based on the effects I was having. Did the negative effects go away after those first few days for you? ⏤ by *Damiana7675* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──── U cant take 2 days and conclude from that, there is usually a «Get used to» phase of any drug that is going to be taken regularly. I also felt negative effects first 3-4 days like i said. This together with your placebo that it could be neurotoxic (no evidence, and quite the opposite) probaly made the effects Worse in your head. Would say u give it another go for the proper 14-20 days and then see what happens after the first few days. My dose was 8mg sublingual first 5 days then 12 subling next days until now day 17. ⏤ by *babbisen* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
