# High dose inositol is surprisingly effective

I've been taking higher doses of inositol for a few days now and have been happy with the effects. It seems to be very good at calming obsessive thinking patterns and rumination. The first time I tried a higher dose I took about 5 grams before sleeping, slept very well but woke up a little groggy, took another few grams at work the next morning. When it kicked in in the morning I felt very sleepy and a little dizzy. I was actually a little worried that it was going to affect my work performance, but when I started talking with other people I found that I was able to focus much better than normal. Usually, my mind is occupied by anxious thoughts, I'll find myself zoning out completely when talking to someone or trying to work on a project, but on the inositol it seemed to be easier to break out of those thoughts and focus on that moment. The only side effects I have experienced are the dizziness, some tiredness, and minor digestive issues/some diarrhea. I would probably recommend slowly working up to a larger dose (I was taking 500mg daily for a while before the larger doses, so I was pretty used to the substance). I also mixed the inositol into a water bottle and took sips over a few hours and I think that helped the digesting issues. Anyway, I've been very happy so far, and I think I will keep taking it for a bit.

##### I'm happy for you, OP!  This stuff is great.

I've been taking 1 Tablespoon (about 10g) every 12 hours for about 3 weeks, and I've had a remarkable improvement in general mood and reduction of anxiety and depression (post divorce related).  The NOW Foods 1-pound bulk brand from Amazon (myo inositol).

For the first time in a couple of years, I've had an up-beat, positive attitude.  Runaway negative thoughts and anxious ruminations that would always spiral out of control until I felt awful have pretty much vanished.  I've actually been venturing out of my comfort zone a bit more, exercising more, doing more work on my place.  Much more content and relaxed.  Finding validation and enjoyment of my professional work.

It's been nice.  The great thing is that it's cheap, at about $25 to $35 per pound on Amazon.

I hope it persists.  I don't know if it needs to be cycled, or if I can reduce the dosage to save money long-term.  I hope this new-found good attitude and feeling will get me to reinforce good behavior patterns, because I don't like the idea of being reliant on anything long-term for my well-being, but this is something I can live with if it means a better quality of life. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 8/ ↓ 0)
├─ Nice! Glad to hear someone else is enjoying it as well. In terms of cycling... I'm not sure either. I've always kind believed that everything should be cycled at least to some degree - even if it's just a couple days once a month. I haven't heard any negative side effects from long term high dose inositol use... But thats just because there's not a lot of info out there about it.  ⏤ by *psychonaut11* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Because of the sweet nature of Inositol powder, it can also be used to sweeten your tea or coffee, provided it is added only once it has cooled down a bit to avoid denaturing.

Coupled with a teaspoon of coconut oil, it can be a very tasty and healthy drink. ⏤ by *MindNutrition* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─ True! But I actually don't think you need to worry much about the temperature. The chemical data sheet from sigma Aldrich for inositol says it can be autoclaved (heated to high temperatures and pressure to kill bacteria) so it can be used in sterile applications. It sounds like it is a very stable compound even in solution.  ⏤ by *psychonaut11* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)

├── Correct, however chemicals can degrade at high temperatures. He used the wrong word but the concept was correct. Although in this situation, inositol doesnt degrade at high temperatures. ⏤ by *25c-nb* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Yep, it was really great for my OCD. I wish I could find the softgel formulation that they talk about on Examine, seems like it would decrease the side effects because you'd have to take less.

http://examine.com/supplements/Inositol/
>If using a soft gel formulation rather than powdered myo-inositol, then only 30% of the same dose is required to be equivalent. This would mean the 14-18g range for psychopharmacological effects is now reduced to 4.2-5.4g of myo-inositol soft gels.

I want to see if someone like /u/MisterYouAreSoDumb or maybe /u/liftmode could stock it, would be so helpful for people like me with OCD, anxiety or whatever else it helps with. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─ This is interesting.  I've checked out the papers linked to from Examine.com (e.g. [Myo-inositol in a new pharmaceutical form: a step forward to a broader clinical use](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1517/17425247.2012.662953)), but the Inositol softgel formulation used in that study is not disclosed and is claimed as patent pending.

In Softgels, the active supplement or ingredient typically must be dissolved or suspended in one of a few compatible carriers ([Soft Gelatin Capsules (Softgels)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283282853_Soft_Gelatin_Capsules_Softgels))

The most common softgel carrier liquids are either triglycerides (i.e. oils like soybean oil) or polyethylene glycols (such as PEG 400), with some optional additives.

The main side effect that occurs with high dose (>10g) inositol consumption are GI upset / laxative effects, likely through an osmotic mechanism.  

Inositol is not soluble in oils such as soybean oil.  It's not immediately obvious how suspending Inositol in soybean oil would improve absorption, but it could possibly reduce the GI side effects by slowing down how quickly the Inositol hits the GI tract. 

Inositol would probably be soluble in PEGs like PEG 400.  However, given that PEGs are osmotic laxatives in their own right in the same gram ranges as Inositol, the PEG would have to be capable both of dissolving very high concentrations of Inositol (to minimize the amount of added PEG), and strongly enhancing Inositol absorption, in order to explain how a PEG based softgel form of Inositol could bypass GI issues.

It's not clear to me that the outer softgel capsule shell does anything to enhance absorption - so, if the study claiming to show equivalent bioavailability of the softgel formulation is legit, then consuming a concentrated suspension of Inositol in oil, or dissolving Inositol in PEG 400 would probably have the same benefit. ⏤ by *liftmode* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
├─ Yeah, I have thought about it. We don't currently have the capabilities for soft gels. However, it's on my list for the future. ⏤ by *MisterYouAreSoDumb* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### I didn't know about this. I also have alot of anxious thoughts, thanks to your post I might try it. Thank you!  ⏤ by *SparkleyRedOne* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### I started doing about 10g before bed every night after hearing a podcast with Charles Poliquin (world-renowned strength coach)--I think a Tim Ferris podcast with him. Charles' claim was that the huge doses of inositol will help balance the neurotransmitter ratios. I haven't checked to verify that claim. Also, the Mensah Medical Group typically recommends inositol for for at least one of the five different categories of depressives (they believe that most problems are epigenetically induced and correctable with enough time through dietary modifications--Bill Walsh's Nutrient Power is worth the read). I feel great on it. Might be worth balancing with at least some of the rest of the B-complex.
