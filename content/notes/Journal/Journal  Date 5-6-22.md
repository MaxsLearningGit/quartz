Mood: better now, 11:01PM, but had a horrible, angry experience today..

Anyways, I woke up at 7 pm, after taking a Vyvanse and sleeping for one extra hour.. Woke up groggy and irritated immediately — <mark>kinda blew up at Mom today because she kinda griped at me (for saying my cologne was thrown away, that I had from HS years ago)… then got really sad and started crying for the next hour or so… </mark>
