# What would be the best noot to take to minimize any possible cardiovascular damage from Vyvanse?

I already take the triple strength fish oil and I would take Agmatine if it didn't give me really weird side-effects from Vyvanse.

Perhaps Taurine due to its possible blood pressure-lowering effects? I haven't considered it much in the past since L-theanine works so well for me.

##### Taurine

Shilajit

Pomegranate extract

Cordyceps

Co Q10 ⏤ by *Significant_Number68* (↑ 15/ ↓ 0)
##### Nac: Is key for any ADHD stimulant, reduces excitotoxicity, mental benefits, improves cardiovascular as well.

Co-enzyme Q10: good for cardiovascular health specifically good for ADHD medications as a antioxidant. 

Fish oil: Good for cardiovascular health and brain health

Agmatine sulfate: Made me feel weird on my meds too maybe try it on your off days or when your medication wears off. Really good for keeping the brain healthy with stimulants, reducing excitotoxicity, reducing tolerance. 

Magnesium: Is pretty key to everything especially with stimulants. Reduces tolerance as well.

Bonus mentions: 

Pomella: Cardiovascular health, antioxidant

Cordyceps: Cardiovascular health, energy, testosterone ⏤ by *eamonn123* (↑ 9/ ↓ 0)

├─ Thanks. I've tried CoQ10 before and didn't really feel much from it but I guess you're not supposed to feel much. And for the Agmatine, I can't even take it on the days off; the first few days after supplementing Agmatine with Vyvanse I was completely fine, but eventually when my Vyvanse would start wearing off I'd get tachycardia, low blood pressure, minor acid reflux, and extreme lightheadedness. These effects persisted for a week after I last took Agmatine. This same exact situation happened when I supplemented with Rhodiola Rosea, but the effects subsided around 1-2 days earlier. ⏤ by *tree_of_tree* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├── Yeah am not sure I've never experienced that! Yeah with Coq10 you won't really feel much from it acutely unless your pair it with shilajit. ⏤ by *eamonn123* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol or generic from PureBulk), Hawthorne and [CoQ10](https://nootropicsdepot.com/coqsol-cf-coenzyme-q10-softgel-capsules-100mg-coq10/). This is also worth consulting: [https://www.addysafe.org/](https://www.addysafe.org/) ⏤ by *Friedrich_Ux* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)

├── I just use it for general heart health ⏤ by *Socialfilterdvit* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Hmm interesting. Is there adverse effects for taking it constantly? I thought it was best to take as heart troubles come up. And do you take a supplement or dry herb? Leaves, flowers or berries? ⏤ by *peoplearestrangeanna* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├──── Ive been using daily for almost 2yrs to lower bp & help ease minor heart inflammation due to mitral valve prolapse and haven't had any adverse effects. I  buy really cheap berry extract tincture $10 a month. Since adding it my bp and cholesterol have both improved enough to stop taking scripts though I take several other supplements as well ⏤ by *Socialfilterdvit* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├───── Do you think it would benefit someone who does not have heart problems, but who takes a relatively high dose (50mg) of vyvanse every day? And do you think the leaves and flowers would be beneficial in this regard? ⏤ by *peoplearestrangeanna* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### If I had to ask that that question, I’d be looking for alternative substances with no direct CV mechanism- such as some of the racetams. I hope you’re acting out of an abundance of caution and not because of a diagnosis or family history. ⏤ by *Black_Cat_Fujita* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I take adderall, not vyvanse, but close enough. I take L theanine (although it seems to have no effect for me anymore), taurine...I would take magnesium but oddly it gives me heart palpitations (I read that it does this to some people.) I have Pomella too but haven't tried it yet.

However, I take a beta blocker and have for years, before getting back on adhd meds. It might be worth asking your dr about adding in a blood pressure medication if your bp runs high on vyvanse. It can't hurt. ⏤ by *Arohnr* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
