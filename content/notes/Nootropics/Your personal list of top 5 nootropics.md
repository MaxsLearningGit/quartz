# Your personal list of top 5 nootropics

I want the safest, the easiest, the most powerful nootropics you can muster.
   
What would you reccommend a noob? What would you advise a seasoned psychonaut? What would you demand your closest family use?

├─ _Fixed the formatting for you_

If I had to pick only 5 that I could take for the rest of my life and never others:

- N-acetyl-Semax Amidate -- first and foremost. Most effective for neurogensis, complete restoration to clarity/lucidity, rapid antidepressant and reversing any existing damages with permanent positive benefits. Drawback cost obviously.
- Pramiracetam -- best (or second best) for increasing creativity, looking at things differently, increased motivation/mood without "push", I would imagine would be my top choice for a racetam/noot taken before sensory deprivation, or intense meditation in an isolated setting.
- Curcumin (with piperine) -- unmatched efficacy for a daily use antidepressant, superior to any SSRI/SNRI/other psychiatric medication I've tried, combined. Minimal side effects, increase brain lucidity, reduced inflammation, among other things. Perfect for not remaining at home "feeling bad for yourself, not getting anything accomplished, not socializing, grim outlook, etc". Drawback of anti-DHT and minor MAOI effects. Excellent for antidepressant without incidence of manic response as is seen with fluoxetine/sertraline/aripiprazole/etc.
- Coluracetam -- color enhancement, thought clarity, feeling "in the flow", boosted creativity, enhanced mood, all in all there's too many benefits to list. Drawback of long-lasting and rapidly generated tolerance, necessary to utilize drug cycling for 7 day periods if 30-40 mg sublingual becomes nearly ineffective.
- PRL-8-53 -- not a dramatic boost in memory, but certainly helpful. Old memories from even childhood or from periods of blackout/amnesia (from benzodiazepines, anticholinergics or otherwise) have completely come to life. Perfect for both studying new information (such as coding, foreign language and medical terminology) as well as helping search your entire memory to remember good times or develop new/more positive outlooks to older memories. Added benefit of norepinephrine release! Can be slightly stimulating in some circumstances, but never overbearingly.

If I had 5 more choices:

- caffeine: very reliable, but highly likely to cause dependence. I consider myself very dependent on caffeine and have been taking 200 mg or more for the past 6 years. Likely unhealthy, withdrawal symptoms aren't too bad to get over, provided there is 48-72 hrs to do so.
- L-alpha-GPC: forget other choline sources. This is by far the best, allows for metabolism to acetylcholine as a sometimes necessary additive to HACUs (coluracetam, ...) or ampakines (oxiracetam, aniracetam, ...) and very often with phenylpiracetam to prevent headache (don't take aspirin/OTC analgesics if this happens--it usually won't work). Choline L-bitartrate cannot penetrate the BBB, centrophenoxine I have not tried, and ALCAR seems discrete, prolonged or indirect in its boosting of ACh, at least in my subjective experience. 
- phenylpiracetam: essential for rapid upregulation of dopamine receptors. Excellent at increasing productivity, motivation, accomplishing multiple tasks at once and increasing verbal fluency. Drawback of often harsh crashes, alleviated instantly or upon the next day with 600 mg a-GPC. Benefit of apparent self-regulation not likely to produce dependence, despite being a psychostimulant with mild hypomanic and euphoriant properties.
- L-theanine: perfect for GABA release or to smooth jitters from caffeine/phenylpiracetam, yet can have paradoxical responses with repeated use or in some individuals (instead of sedation/relaxation, causing slight restlessness). Replace with fasoracetam if this happens--I don't trust Phenibut due to alleged dependence liability--but I do not enjoy CNS depressants as it is, yet why take the chance?
- IDRA-21: the surefire best way to jolt the brain into gas-mode by causing a surge of glutamatergic response (this can be a good thing). Very effective at rapidly restoring to an almost hypomanic state out of any lowest depression and excellent for ending bad dissociative trips, almost instantaneously (DXM/ketamine/MXE/PCP). Awesome for reversing damage from monosodium glutamate. Use very cautiously, half-life upwards of 48 hours. Drawback of very readily causing suicidal thoughts if dose is too high (perhaps higher than even 10 mg) or in combination with other glutamatergics. ⏤ by *WhateverChomp* (↑ 82/ ↓ 0)
├── Coooool, you use ampakines like I do. Although I prefer Unifiram over IDRA-21. Basically allows me to sober up from any psychoactive substance (weed, dissos, even alc). Smooth and more of a wakefulness promoting agent feel than stimulated one. Much shorter duration as well so there isn't the irritability caused by the long duration like IDRA. 

I'm wondering if this sobering effect of ampakines would be effective with psychedelics and stimulants. Haven't tried that combo yet and have an intuition that it wouldn't work as well as the other ones, but I'd prefer it over benzos for ending trips/rolls if it did. ⏤ by *kyzersozei* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)

├──── Ahhh there it is, I've read about psychedelics also releasing glutamate before but forgot and couldn't put my finger on why I thought that they wouldn't be as effective for that. I'll be sticking to benzos and phenibut for bad trips and anxiety reduction then. 

I have tried Unifiram and IDRA-21 but not Sunifiram or Aniracetam. For me, IDRA-21 is too long lasting and tends to make me irritable after the first day or so. Also get way more headaches than I would like to and nothing really seems to help them (eating, drinking, rest, etc.). I'm thinking that a sunifiram would be a shorter lasting version of IDRA-21 because of how the anecdotal reports sound with stronger stimulation and more headaches than unifiram. Unifiram is surprisingly subtle and almost feels like the glutamate rebound effect that sometimes happens when I wake up after drinking alcohol (alcohol afterglow). I just feel awake and aware with a small microdose-like effect as well. This combined with the fact that it's more of. 5-6 hour duration as opposed to 48 like IDRA makes it much more appealing to me.  ⏤ by *kyzersozei* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

•This is exactly what I am experimenting with it for. I do suffer from minor GAD and so the last couple of days on DHM has been quite a pleasant surprise. It feels like I'm on a long lasting theanine that is quietening but un-inhibiting. I have found out that it potentiates GABAA receptors, which is super fascinating.

How do you feel the addictiveness? I'm just curious because though my dad was a confirmed smoker since he was 22, and now can't quit the gum either. However, I tried gum first, then smoking, and did not find any addictive qualities. When I'm stressed, I do find wanting to go for a smoke, however this started before I ever tried smoking and is likely to be due to mental ideation, rather than any actual addiction (although maybe that is what addiction is anyway).

##### Safe(r):
1. [[KSM-66]] - use this almost everyday twice a day with little to no tolerance buildup and strong anxiolytic effects 
2. [[Synapsa]] - noticeable WM and general memory increase, also longer attention span. Acute anxiolytic effect when taken but  makes my stomach upset sometimes
3. [[Rhodiola]] (3:1 R/S) - when taken at the end of a tiring day, brings me back to above baseline energy levels and gives a great mood boost (only 2-3 times per week though)
4. Caffeine x L-Theanine - caffeine w/o the negatives, used when I'm not taking Rhodiola 
5. [[Phenylpiracetam]] - energy, clear thoughts, slight silver tongue, decreased social anxiety. Just has tolerance issues 

Stronger/Less Safe "Noots"
1. [[Phenibut]] - noot? Debatable, but most of this list is comprised of these types. Last lasting strong anxiolytic with no cognitive drawbacks like benzos. 
2. [[Modafinil]] - ofc, basically eliminates sleeping from the equation and allows for consistent working 
3. [[RGPU-95]] - actually never tried this, have it on the way. Supposedly phenylpiracetam without the strong tolerance issues. May review it when I get it. 
4. Alcohol - hahaha. This is specifically in combo with phenibut. High risk. Taking 1-3 drinks while on phenibut vastly increases the anxiolytic effects. Be careful thought very easy to go overboard. 
5. Weed - yep. Just a hit or two (or crazy small amount if you have no tolerance). I find that it potentiates other noots and allows me to think deeper and clearer in real small doses. Also super easy to take too much though.  ⏤ by *kyzersozei* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

2. Acetyl L-Carnitine
3. Piracetam

##### To my list I haven't tried real chemical nootropics (except noopept) but I am a Bodybuilder who is consuming slot of supplements like
Creatine 5g
Coffeine 200mg
Synephrin dosage depends 
Beta alanine 5g
Magnesium citrate 3g
Zinc 25-50mg
Fish oil 5-6 g in capsules
D3 10.000-15.000 i.e
K2 200mcg
Taurin 1-3g
L-Arginin 5-10g

These things will only help your brain when you have an unbalanced diet I don't really feel an effect from all these supplements where some people claim that they have nootropic effects. Indeed someone who eats unhealthy will probably have an nootropic effects from these supplements. I only tried Noopept , Microdosing(1-p-LSD) and Methylphenidate till now. Methylphenidate is an Amphetamine not more not less focus with damage. Microdosing is in my opinion something for your mood and creativity. But Noopept (15-35mg Nasal) is the ideal nootropic for my self with no recognizable side effects except of a higher body temperature it really gave me focus and motivation also I have a higher self-confidence when talking with people. My memory increased a bit but the biggest effect is my brain is not getting tired by learning. Trie what is best for your self and less if often more in nootropics. I would also recommend semax but I haven't tried it till now

Your top 5 is actually 10 items of which several you never even used.         ⏤ by *kittenhormones* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)

├── Hit up eBay.  I'd still advise getting it tested on principle alone, even if the seller is highly rated.  If you don't want to have it tested, and you'd like it capped check out Intellimeds. ⏤ by *Nobody35593* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

├──── Yea, but depending on the price of testing it may only be worth it to buy in bulk, and if it did come back with insufficient purity what a waste that'd be. At any rate there is always the option of getting your ting your own batch synthesized if or when you have the money.

I wonder if they ever got that NRX-1074 synth group buy up and running again on Longecity?  I remember hearing Nyles7’s account of getting a dirty GLYX-13 batch from China or somewhere sketch like that, which psychoactively speaking appeared to go quite well, if not physically speaking...  If I get the cash before it hits the consumer market, I'm definitely getting a large clean batch of GLYX-13 or it's orally active analogue NRX-1074. ⏤ by *Nobody35593* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

├────── I know right, they have been such a uniform class of drugs over the years that the term anti-depressant has basically become a synonym for SSRIs, it's so interesting to see new compound make their way into the mix.  My interest in GLYX-13 was peaked due to it's apparent ability to improve learning speed (like up to 90% according to animal studies), I think it has a lot of nootropic potential. ⏤ by *Nobody35593* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

├──────── LOL, those Latuda adds are the funniest!

But yea, a part of me wonders what the DIY Pharma movement (which is effectively what the Nootropic movement ended up becoming; better living through chemistry) has played in the world of Big Pharma drug development.  To be honest at this point I think those with many kinds depression / mental illness are better off on Nootropic subclass Anxiolytics, on the variety of compounds to choose from alone (not to mention we have corporate drugs still in development in our arsenal as well). ⏤ by *Nobody35593* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Sleep,
Exercise
Food + Water

Seriously, the above three are proven and will give you the biggest bang for your buck above anything else you add to your system. 

With that, for a noob, I'd add 2 more which seem to be the gateway drug of choice for new nootropic users.

L-Theanine
Caffeine ⏤ by *huginn* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### every one is different  

for me its  BSO - Vitamin D - Vitamin B100 + lion mane 

but imafarmdog has a VERY good list there which i will steal   ⏤ by *bojee123* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### 1. Flmodafinil
2. Caffeine
3. L-Theanine

##### My top 5

1. Modafinil
2. Memantine 
3. Black seed oil
4. Celastrus oil
5. Fasoracetam

Honorable mention goes to Vortioxetine, which is pretty great as well.  ⏤ by *HartleyWorking* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├── Previously I got it from my local pharmacy, but my insurance isn't covering it or armoda anymore so I might have to look into modafinilkat or filmodafinil. 

As for my experiences with it; It's the tits, basically. I have a pretty mild case of narcolepsy and it takes me from a feeling of all day grogginess and bad mood (I basically feel like my one chance to nap has been interrupted, but all day long) to a productive and relatively positive frame of mind, pretty much 100% of the time. 

But that's just my n=1. YMMV.  ⏤ by *HartleyWorking* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### Phenylpiracetam, phenibut, green tea (basically l-theanine and caffeine, but quality green tea like Matcha/Sencha works better for me) and creatine are my favourites. Ashwagandha is would be the fifth one but I only tested it once or twice since I can't take it due to hypothyroidism. ⏤ by *Black_stranger* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I have tried

Modvigil  
Modafinil 
Armodafinil 
Artvigil
Waklert

Out of all 5, I recommend Armodafinil for those people on whom modafinil has no effect, it's 150mg and much safer than those 200mg pills, I didn't get much sleep after Modalert 200mg, so I stopped using those. ⏤ by *rodneyloy* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

Hepa Air Filter and Ionizer in bedroom on at all times

##### Here is my list that keeps it simple:
Green tea, Vitamin B12 (the good stuff not the cheap stuff), Magnesium (for the next day), probiotic foods + fiber (kimchi, kefir, kombucha also fits item A), and most important of all.. exercise.   ⏤ by *AcaciaBlue* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Modafinil

Caffeine (i like to drink a bunch of green tea to stay hydrated) 

Runners high (running in the AM helped my school performance and turned me into a morning person)

Whatever is in nerd focus (great for short term memory, feels dirty) 

Good scheduling/time management and peace of mind

├─ you talk like its legal and available anywhere, its not like the other nootropics.. being afraid to use is not the reason ⏤ by *bodevelho* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── well it is legal in the US **Desoxyn** but its a hydrochloride formulation - what he is talking about is freebase 

but i dont know why he thinks its an injectable testosterone 

anyways this this the most disastrous recommendation possible - regardless if you have "purpose" or not u can not over ride the very strong high that is meth and all of its downsides - why not use adderall or dexedrine instead  ⏤ by *bojee123* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─── Even adderall or dexedrine need a prescription from a doctor. Not everyone that has the need for a nootropic has ADHD and is able to get them. I mean in my opinion you don't need to have ADHD to benefit from Adderall. My opinion is this substance could be used as any other nootropic and it would have very positive results, but they are not easy to get them, even if they are legal. ⏤ by *bodevelho* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
