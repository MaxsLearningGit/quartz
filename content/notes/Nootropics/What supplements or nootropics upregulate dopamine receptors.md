# What supplements/ nootropics up regulate Dopamine receptors in the brain?

What’s up, I’m looking for the best ways to enhance dopaminergic signaling without causing a down regulatory effect on dopamine’s receptors in the brain. 

I’m genuinely curious what you think will be the most effective at doing this? 

I’m open to all types of ways, and am interested in any anecdotal evidence/ user experiences, and efficacy that you think is great to share on this. 

Or you can just share the compounds that can achieve this if you don’t have that kind of time, that’s cool too. 

🙃✌️

##### ALCAR, Bromantane, CDP-Choline, Heard good things about Shilajit and Cordyceps but both are pretty backed by marketing and lack great studies. Sulbuthiamine works. Recently heard berberine might also through gut regulation. Now not all of these work through increased receptors but they do one way or another raise dopamine levels.

Raising dopamine receptors or upregulating is a bit of a pain at first as CDP and Sulbuthiamine both work by lowering dopamine at first which eventually the brain up regulates dopamine receptors to compensate. Same thing happens when you constantly hit that dopamine and eventually it down regulates. So if you’re in a downregulated state as most people probably are to some degree in modern vices society. It’ll be a rough transition at first but you’ll see gains by sticking with it. ⏤ by *Spirited_Gap7644* (↑ 24/ ↓ 0)
├─ I'm really new to all this but I take ritalin for my ADHD but want to prevent becoming too insensitive to it. If I took CDP-Choline would that mess up what the ritalin is doing or is there a way to take both?

├── It shouldn’t mess it up. Besides what he mentioned, definitely take good fish oil and a quality multivitamin. Vitamin C and Vitamin Bs help build dopamine if I can remember correctly.

There are more, except these are the ones that come to mind. I made videos about a lot of these substances like alcar for example if your curious to learn more. [https://youtu.be/MwgYKiKgoYQ](https://youtu.be/MwgYKiKgoYQ) ⏤ by *eamonn123* (↑ 18/ ↓ 0)

├─── >D2 are regulatory and help control thoughts

can OCD suffers benefit? Why do the OCD treatments target serotonin? ⏤ by *luchins* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── I'm not sure if certain supplements would help, but yes D2 receptors are theorized to be at least indirectly involved in the pathogenisis of OCD. D1 receptors are as well and together these receptors form the "accelerator-brake" pathway. An inbalance of these receptors with increased D1 activity would disinhibit the thalamus and promote OCD-like behaviors. 

Look into "Baxter's model" regarding the pathogenisis of OCD, though it looks more into the glutamate-gaba connection to ocd. Baxter's model is one of the more accepted theories.

Sulbutiamine does not alter D2r expression, it effects D1r sites. Forskolin effects expression of both. Apologies, but i shan't be watching your videos. You could however post correct information, or correct it after posting. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### This is a topic which is discussed here and at r/stackadvice ad nauseum, probably at the very least once daily... whether it's drug users looking to increase effects of stimulants, curious campers who read somewhere online that "upregulating dopamine receptors" is a magical cure for everything mentally inhibiting, or people afflicted with conditions such as ADD who do not wish daily stimulant use or wish to mediate some possible negatives of daily stimulant use and so on... Whatever it may be, "upregulated dopamine receptors" is not an automatic positive to our health nor a negative, it is a part of our adaptive mechanisms, and can be a byproduct or result of our medication use and supplementations. In any case, i'd like to remind a few things regarding this:

1. Artificial alteration of dopamine receptor expression, up or down, can be beneficial as well as debilitating. To research this, one can simply start with the outcomes of people prescribed anti-psychotic medications (mostly first generation) or those on dopamine agonist medications. Both groups directly impact dopamine receptors to varying degrees and produce usually inevitable outcomes as a result of this, those rarely positive part from the intended "therapeutic value" they represent in treatment... E.g. early use of some dopamine agonists led some people to courts for committing crimes of sexual assaults, financially motivated ones due to debts of, e.g., uncontrollable gambling, or similar due to their role in severely impeding impulse control and distorting the neuronal processes of arousal... other instances are the debilitating cognitive and other health outcomes of "mentally lobotomized" psychiatric patients by anti-psychotics...
2. Alterations of dopamine receptor expressions by supplements, herbs or nootropics are not necessarily anything significant enough to produce neuronal changes to effect mental health, in fact, this rarely is of any significance in the real world. The findings in some modest studies on animals are often nothing more than hints to how they may effect humans, and are not meritably confirmed, or not confirmed yet.
3. To possibly ensure, or at least receive some greater guarantee that the sought change in the dopaminergic system functioning would be beneficial, one could probably consider the natural ways to achieve this, at least first, which is of course also repeated ad nauseum, and yet: increased physical activity/exercise is *proven* quite sufficiently to do just that, as is greater outgoing outdoors, even the habit of indulging in some pleasant music can sensitize the system to dopamine activity and is indeed studied for this effect.

Just some things to consider... ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├─ Thank you for stating this so clearly. I do think that many think of “up regulation” is good and “down regulation” is bad. The examples you provide should correct that notion. Your post should be reprinted by a bot every time this question arrises. ⏤ by *infrareddit-1* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

really? Do modern dopamine agonist cause all that? ⏤ by *luchins* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├── Not exactly. Earlier on dosages of these medications were excessive, at least this was the conclusion. Dopamine agonist don't necessarily cause this, these are isolated cases i mentioned to show severe outcomes were possible. They can however impact sexual drives and impulse control at most dosages, e.g. some people use cabergoline for sexual enhancement, and issues with impulse control is a common side effect Parkinson's patients experience when started on bromocriptine or pramipexole etc.. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── >some people use cabergoline for sexual enhancement

yes. I'd have question since sexual pleasure is driven by dopamine, can dopamine agonists enanche sexual experience with a girl you don't like that much?
