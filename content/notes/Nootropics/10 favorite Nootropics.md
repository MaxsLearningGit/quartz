# 10 favorite nootropics

What are your top 10 nootropics? [Either pills or diet] 

These nootropics I take every single day of the year, no matter what. That simplifies life a lot. I like that. 

Here is my nootropic stack:
1. 25mg Modafinil [Since yesterday] - first thing I take in the morning - I have light ADD, modafinil makes me feel more organized, a zen like peace in my mind. It helped me get things done. 
2. 500mg Bacopa [since 0.5 years] - Brings me into flow state. Research said it will give you 20% better verbal memory. True. 
3. 500mg Green tea [since 0.5 years] - enhances my flow state. 
4. 600 ecg fish oil [since 6 years] 
5. 1000mg Magnesium lactate [since 10+ years] - helps my muscles relax. Also I sleep even better with magnesium. 
6. 40μg vit D3 [since 10+ years] 

Diet:
1. 60g Sardines [since 6 years] - makes me feel overall happy. It is my favorite medicine to take when I have a cold or throat ache. 
2. 10-25g organic cacao [since 6 years] - Makes me feel even very happy. 25g equals caffeine of half cup of coffee. 
3. 10g bee pollen - benefits of honey with less sugar. 
4. No sugar, except fruits or 4th ingredient [since 0.5 years] - After 2-4 weeks exact same energy levels. Since then less foggy mind and even more energy. 

These nootropics combined doubled my productivity in the last half year, literally. People are surprised how much energy I got, how quick I can talk and think. They call me a natural charismatic and energetic person. I know better. These nootropic stacks are my secret! 

I used to have trouble focussing on listening. I got easily bored and distracted. Now I listen only to double speed audiobooks, effortlessly for hours on end. I used to take daily power naps, now I just blast through the day. 

I am curious, what are your favorite 10 nootropics?

##### I take nootropics to treat my anxiety/paranoia, and some mild psychotic symptoms (I used to audio hallucinate whenever sleep deprived- before starting this journey into noots). My doctors didn't prescribe me medications because I'm functional enough I suppose.

Stack:

* Ginko Biloba 120mgs (for a year) decreased my schizophrenia-like symptoms to a point where I now rarely audio hallucinate- perhaps on average once every 2 weeks when before, I'd have brain glitches multiple times a day
* Super Ginseng Complex: 400mgs (3 months now) I take this in the evening after a long day at work or school, helps me wind down and also concentrate on projects
* P-5-P (active form of B6) - (for a year) promotes wakefulness and coherency
* Resveratrol (4 years) improves my digestion and mood
* Curcumin: (3 years) reduces inflammation, has an acute effect on depression, which I no longer have
* Daily vitamins, minerals and probiotics - last two years, feel overall healthier with increased energy, my significant other of three years has noticed a difference
* Alpha GPC - (for two weeks) I take 600mgs during the days I'm sleep deprived. I used to have horrible insomnia (Id have on average 4 or 5 hours of sleep a night) and sometimes I still struggle. This gives me the amount of energy I'd have on a normal day. However if I take this when I'm well rested, I'm too energized and get horrible anxiety
* Bacopa - (for the last 3 months) I take 900mgs at night, it helps me sleep a full 8-9 hours. This is a miracle supplement for me, it has improved my quality of life 10 fold. My memory is so much better than it used to be. I'm much more organized and I can compile sentences together a lot better on papers. Life is wonderful when your memory of the timeline of your life is like a book rather than tiny pages that disappear after you are no longer in the moment, if that makes any sense. I can look at my girlfriend and remember her as the person I met over 3 years ago. Before this supplement I honestly had goldfish memory
* Lions Mane - I take this if I have a big paper or project to complete and I need a boost of energy. I don't take this daily however, because it makes me feel off, or under the influence
* Cacao powder: elevates my mood subtly

&#x200B;

Diet or Lifestyle:

I don't drink or use drugs, including weed. I smoked weed for 5 years. I have no regrets but I believe that lifestyle is part of the reason I needed to take drugs (ironically) to get a cognitive boost. I used to be a lot smarter

* Meditation: (for the last 3 years) literally my anti depressant. Without meditation my life wouldn't be where it is. It decreases my depression and anxiety, helps me see where I need to be in life; I drop grudges, work on myself, and become grateful. There is no way I can emphasis enough how wonderful meditation is
* Running: I became a runner 5 years ago because the endorphins after a 45 minutes run would help me curve my cravings of pot. Yes, I used to be that much of a stoner. Running has made me more coherent and less depressed, it's almost as good as meditation. I try to run 3-4 times a week.
* Eating an organic diet, with four servings of fruits and veggies a day, less carbs, lot of healthy fats, etc. I feel high on life and as a plus, it apparently made me attractive on the outside. I get hit on constantly now
* Blueberries: improves memory
* Walnuts: improves cognitive function
* Raw ginger: increases energy output
* Caffeine (of course) specifically Matcha. Helps me focusss
* Avoiding TV and Netflix and other brain-draining entertainment
* Blue light 
* Cold showers

&#x200B;

I'm one of those people that will tell you I cured my depression and anxiety with a healthy lifestyle. I'm walking evidence, and I love this community for all that it has taught me

&#x200B;

As a plus I'll include the noots that did NOT work for me:

* Acetyl L Carnitine (increases my anxiety 10 fold)
* Rhodiola: I feel great, however it increases the saturation of my vision to 100 (Imagine photoshop). Colors are too sickly vivid, so I know something is off. It reminds me of how I felt when tripping on magic mushrooms
* Adderall: even on only 5mgs I felt high as fuck. It also made my memory worse. I might as well take ecstasy or snort coke
* Alpha GPC (every day) just makes me way too anixous, this is a last resort for when I'm fatigued and caffeine wont do shit

##### What is D3 and IE? 
I use noopept 10mg twice a day, Alpha gpc 170mg twice and NSI 189 10-15mg twice.
I want to try modafinil but its so expensive and you always need to order 30+ pills ⏤ by *tonio_CC* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├─ 1. D3 means vit D3. It basically eliminates winter depression. IU means international unit, which is another weight unit than grams or Oz. quite useless I wrote it down, I removed it! 
2. Not always you have to buy large batches. I ordered only 10 pills. from a European website though. Afinilexpress dot Com sells all over the world. Here is the best guide on buying modafinil from any country over the world. https://modafinil.org/buy-modafinil-online/
3. Expensive? It depends on your serving size! 30 cents a day is reasonable, some people take 8x more than me [they take 200mg] and that starts becoming pricey indeed!
4. Noopept and especially alpha gpc sound very promising! Can you maybe extent a bit on both of them and how they make you feel?  ⏤ by *MaxIsKoning* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── At the moment I don't have to much time to write to much so I copied a description I wrote a few weeks ago.


"For Noopept you take it for an 1-3 months cycle and you will be way more focused and get stuff done. It can be pretty subtle but can also bring an "concentration kick" where you do the thing you do on autopilot, meaning your brain works without you actively thinking about the task. (happend to me while writting an Essay, I was really focused,  thought about nothing and just typed it down nonstop)

The Tactic I have adopted while taking Noopept is, that I break down my work into smaller portion which I can do very fast. It also helps my sleeping cycle. This I have monitored using an APP called "Sleep Android", before taking Noopept I had between 20-30% of deep Sleep per Night, Now I get between 50 and 80%, even while on a long break of Nootropics. I have to mention, that I also stopped doing other drugs including alcohol and coffein(no real tea). I have heard that coffein is sometimes used as a Nootropic, but because of my tendency towards bad Sleep I stopped it completely. 

To get back to the maintopic. I use 10mg of Noopept sublingual with 250mg of Alpha-GPC in gelatin capsules. I have now started adding 10mg of NSI-189 Phosphate to my stack, but I need to find an other vendor, because mine is way to expensive (but their NSI-189 is great). Noopept and Alpha-GPC I take twice a day, once in the morning at about 7am, one hour after I got up and once at around 3pm. 

The Effects are really strong, Noopept and Alpha-GPC do give you Energy and Motivation to study for 8 hours straight and understand the material. But unlike Modafinil, Speed, Adderal or other uppers, they help you to build neuronal connections and grow new neurons and it justs seems as if you are understanding the things that you do really good pretty fast. These neurons grrowing effects are longterm effects, so even if you stop taking it your memory, ability to learn etc. will stay better than before. However it also takes a while to build these neurons or neural pathways. I don't remember any exact numbers for Noopept, but in NSI-189 it is said that it takes about 18 days or something like that. 

For NSI-189 I can not say to much about it because I have just tried it for my first time today at about 1pm. At my place it now is 6pm and I still feel the effects of it. I walked throught the city and could appreciate the beauty of the architecture and the nature surrounding me much more than before. My Sense perception was stronger, I could hear the sounds of a trolley that a woman was carrying across the street, all the colors were much warmer and everything had   life in it (this is hard to describe). It was similair to the upcome of MDMA or LSD but it did not have the drug characteristique to it, it was closer to reality. It felt as if a filter that was over my perception has been changed so that the positive and beautiful things get emphasized. 
I also just took 10mg of NSI-189, although some sources say that the normal dose is at about 40mg 2-3 times a day. 

If I find a cheap vendor for NSI-189 I want to try this Plan:
1st Week 10mg NSI, 10mg Noopept, 250 mg GPC all twice a day
2nd Week 20mg NSI, 10mg Noopept, 250mg GPC twice a day
3rd Week 30mg NSI, 10mg Noopept, 250mg GPC 2x a day
4th Week 40mg NSI, 10mg Noopept, 250mg GPC 2x a day"


Also I am also from Europe(Austria), could you send me the vendors website per private message and thank you for the tipps. ⏤ by *tonio_CC* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─── Noopept is something I researched to consider try to ng but it seems to benefit only those with cognitive decline and not normal average people? And Alpha-GPC I haven't heard of yet, but bc you say unlike Adderall which I do take, it builds new neural connections and new neurons, you say. That alone makes this combo interesting for me to research further as my dad's side of the family seems to have a history of Parkinson's and dementia, sadly, so taking psych meds over the past 18 years may have caused conditions I would like reversed. Would this work for these? Could it replace Adderall?

For me phenibut also enhances my senses like you describe with NSI. I also find more beauty in nature, feel more connected to other people esp my two little kids. I enjoy music so much better. I exercise at the gym and workout so much longer and more intensely without issues but extreme euphoria. I also have MDMA/MDA like effects while on it every day so far. I know phenibut has a bad rep for it's tolerance and possible withdrawal but for me, I don't experience much of either maybe due to other things I take as nootropics, amino acids, supplements, tea, etc... Plus my meds I have to take which I am able to taper off of easily due to mainly the effectiveness of phenibut among other things which have helped me get off 2 sleep meds + melatonin, for starters. But of course I also titrate up as needed and then taper off when needed. It is just a supplement/possible nootropic that requires respect and no abuse to achieve recreational values.

But if NSI has all of this without the potential for tolerance or withdrawal, I would be interested in trying it and researching it more. ⏤ by *djpurity666* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──── I never did adderall nor phenibut.

I have hears bad things about adderal from a regular speed user describing the addiction to adderal as the worst thing they ever experienced.

Just as a word of warning Noopept and NSI-189 is powerful but it is really subtle, many people want immediate effect, but their effect only come with time. 

For the immediate effects I will try modafinil.

Also my goal is to get away from everything with addiction potential or everything that does damage for short-term fun/energy.
Also quit Weed, alcohol, mdma and all these things.

├─ Vitamin D usually comes in the form of vitamin D3. It helps with a lot of processes in the body as well as mood.

I got my vitamin D levels tested and they were short of recommended values. Usually we get vitamin D from the sun thru our skin. I am outside daily, so I am deficient by getting it naturally.

I was told by my doctor to take 5000mcg daily for 6mo and then 2000mcg daily for the rest of my life... Wow, right?

So get yourself checked sometime to find out how to elevate it to effective levels :-) ⏤ by *djpurity666* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

├─ Great question! I just started with modafinil and 50mg 12 hours before sleep caused already sleep problems! Today was my first day 25mg, and felt very little. I read 1 other guy who took 25mg, 1 who takes 33mg. Tomorrow I will try 50mg and hope on good sleep!  ⏤ by *MaxIsKoning* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

Adderall is a one stop to all ⏤ by *mind_scientist* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
##### My 10 fave Nootropics are hard to pick.
But in no order: DMAE, phenibut, dl-phenylalanine (DLPA), Adderall, l-tyrosine, l-glutamine, l-theanine, caffeine, l-tryptophan, and NAC.

That's 10 right? I have so many more favorites! I didn't get to mention SAM-e (for producing l-dopa naturally), valerian and lemon balm (for promoting GABA by preventing it from breaking down among other things), l-glycine, taurine, ashwagandha, l-methionine, and a few more...

DMAE is shown to help with ADHD symptoms like focus and concentration and learning. Phenibut actually gives me great focus and motivation which has led me to needing my Adderall I take for my ADHD way less which typing this has led me to remember I forgot my afternoon dose again, DLPA boosts my mood and endorphins and dopamine, l-tyrosine boosts my concentration and catecholamines incl dopamine, l-glutamine for energy as well as balancing GABA/glutamate, l-theanine for enhancing caffeine while aiding in GABA/glutamate balance, Adderall obv for ADHD and concentration and focus, caffeine for energy and focus and motivation (in the form of black chai tea and green matcha tea plus caffeine gum where 1piece = 1/2 cup coffee), l-tryptophan for balancing out dopamine as well as production of serotonin and melatonin, and NAC for  treating any addiction issues or OCD and many other reasons. Actually all of them have many more benefits I didn't mention due to not wanting to be too loquacious here ;-)

Edit - my diet is vegetarian/vegan, so I don't get all of the amino acids naturally. But avacado is considered one of best foods to eat and I definitely eat those. I also eat Ezekiel sprouted grain bread that is made according to some verse in the book of the Bible called Ezekiel which in this form produces full protein chains like animal proteins do. I also eat a lot of plant based protein. To help compensate for anything I miss I take a food-based multivitamin with fermented foods (great for GABA production among other benefits), along with other essential amino acids and nutrients. I take a probiotic mainly due to past and current med use disrupt the body's natural gut microbes which can help with mood and fight brain fog as well as boost absorption of other nutrients. ⏤ by *djpurity666* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

##### Armodafinil, phenylpiracetam, noopept, PRL-8-53, CBD, caffeine, grapefruit juice(?), Mucuna. That's about all I can think of, in no particular order.

├── The effects are inconsistent so it’s hard for me to compare the two. Sometimes Armo works better than Moda and vice versa, so I switch them around.
